<p><strong>TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE</strong></p>

<p>This book was published in 1839 and was compiled from manuscripts
and printed records from 1560 to 1616 regarding the early history
of the Reformed Church in Scotland. The language was ‘Middle Scots’
and the spelling was not at all consistent, but it was a careful
reproduction of the source records. This etext maintains that
integrity and no spelling changes have been made to the 1839 text.</p>

<p>During this period (1560 to 1616) documents used the Julian calendar
for dates, where the new year did not begin until March 25th. In this
book dates on some documents before that date show both the Julian
year, and the Gregorian year in <span class="nowrap">( ),</span> for example the Twenty-Seventh
General Assembly was held on ‘the 6th of March 1572(3)’.</p>

<p>The yogh character ȝ appears occasionally, though more often z is
used in its place, which was a common printing practice at that time.
The text for example has both ȝit and zit (yet), failȝie and failzie
(failure or default), ȝeirlie and zeirlie (yearly), ȝouth and zouth
(youth).</p>

<p>The character ł (letter l with stroke) is used on <a href="#Page_119">page 119</a>.</p>

<p>Footnote anchors are denoted by <span class="fnanchor">[number]</span>,
and the footnotes have been placed at the end of the book.</p>

<p>Where the text had blank space, the etext inserts {blank space}.</p>

<p>Where the text had multiple spaced dots <span class="nowrap">(eg . . . . .)</span> to indicate
missing text, the etext inserts ... (an ellipsis). There were no
ellipses in the original text.</p>

<p>Where the text had three or more asterisks <span class="nowrap">(eg * * *)</span> to indicate
missing text, the etext inserts {missing text indicated by asterisks}.</p>

<p>Where the text had a phrase marked by the editor, in brackets <span class="nowrap">[ ],</span> the
etext leaves that unchanged. <a href="#Footnote_14">Footnote [14]</a>
explains the reason for these [notations].</p>

<p>Some other minor changes to the text are noted at the <a href="#TN">end of the book.</a></p>

<p class="p3 pfs80">“BOOKE OF THE UNIVERSALL KIRK.”</p>


<p class="p2 noindent">The printing of this, the earliest Record of the Reformed
Church in Scotland, has now reached a period in the history
of that Church, which renders it fitting that this impression
should be accompanied with a more precise statement than
has yet been given of its character and its fate.</p>

<p>For many years past, Dr Lee, Principal Clerk of the General
Assembly, made strenuous, but ineffectual, exertions, to
recover for the Church, the original Record of the period extending
from 1560 to 1616. That Record, which is known
to historians by the title of the “Booke of the Universall
Kirk,” had been surreptitiously purloined, and found its way
into the hands of the Trustees of Sion College, in London; and
although hopes were latterly entertained that their restoration
to the Church might be effected, these hopes are now at an
end. During the investigations which were instituted by a
Committee of the House of Commons, on the subject of
Church Patronage in Scotland, in the year 1834, three volumes
of the Record were produced by the official custodier of
them, for the consideration of that Committee. Their authenticity
was established by the testimony of Dr Lee, and other
competent judges; and the Committee having suspended its
investigations, and made a report of the evidence which it had
obtained, these Books were left in the keeping of the clerks,
and perished in the great conflagration by which the Houses
of Parliament were consumed, on the 16th of October 1834.</p>

<p>Such is briefly the history of the valuable Record of which
these pages contain many of the earlier Acts and proceedings
in the Church of Scotland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ii"></a>[ii]</span></p>

<p>It is natural to suppose, that, during the first century of
its existence, the political and ecclesiastical revolutions which
took place in Scotland subsequently to the year 1560, the Records
of the Church could not escape unscathed amid the turmoils
of conflicting factions in Church and State. It appears
from the MS. <cite>Abbreviates</cite><a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> still extant, that, betwixt the years
1580 and 1587, the earlier portions of the General Assembly’s
Registers, filling five volumes, had passed into the hands of
Adamson, Bishop of St Andrews, and had suffered mutilation
(were “mankit”) by him, or, as has been alleged, by his Royal
Master, King James VI., in order to destroy the proofs of submission
by certain Prelates to the jurisdiction of the General
Assembly. During a certain space, however, it is proved that
they were not in possession of the Church or its Officers; and
when, in the years 1586 and 1587, the custody of the Books
was reclaimed by the Assembly, they were allowed by the
King’s Commissioner to be exhibited to that Judicatory,&mdash;but
with a proviso, that at the close of each sederunt, they were to
be redelivered to the Lord Privy Seal.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> There is no satisfactory
evidence known to us with respect to the custody of these
Books during the space which elapsed till the year 1638, when
they were again recovered by the Presbyterian Church&mdash;fully
authenticated&mdash;and once more restored to the custody of the
Clerk of Assembly as the legitimate custodier.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The subsequent history of these volumes&mdash;the best, perhaps,
that can now be given&mdash;is to be found in a “Statement” concerning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iii"></a>[iii]</span>
them, drawn up by Dr John Lee, the present Clerk of
the General Assembly, in 1828, and printed in 1829, with the
view of effecting the recovery of these Registers from the
Trustees of Sion College, who, as already stated, had obtained
possession of them. Dr Lee having kindly communicated a
copy of that “Statement,” we gladly avail ourselves of the
opportunity of embodying it entire on this occasion.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Statement</span> concerning three Volumes of the Earliest
Records of the Church of Scotland, now deposited in
Sion College, London.</p>
</div>

<p>“A few years ago, a Committee of the General Assembly
of the Church of Scotland was appointed for the purpose of
collecting and recovering the various Manuscripts, connected
with their Ecclesiastical Establishment; and, among other objects
to which this Committee were desired to direct their attention,
they were specially instructed to print the ancient Record,
entitled, ‘The Book of the Universal Kirk of Scotland.’</p>

<p>“It has been discovered that this Book, extending to three
volumes, is extant in the Library of Sion College, London.
But after much correspondence, and repeated applications,
not only do the Governors of the College refuse to restore the
volumes upon any terms, but even to permit a copy of the
work to be taken, or allow a collation with the partial <cite>Abbreviates</cite>
of it preserved in Scotland; the College stating,
that they would not be justified in so doing, under the Deed
of Trust by which the possession of these volumes was acquired
by the College.</p>

<p>“There is no difficulty in proving that the volumes in question
were laid on the table of the General Assembly which
met at Glasgow in 1638; and that they were pronounced by
that Assembly to be true and authentic Registers of the Kirk
of Scotland. The reasons proving their authenticity are inserted
in the manuscript journals of that Assembly, and also,
in a very satisfactory form, in the printed <ins class="corr" id="tn-iii" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'Acts of the Genera'">
Acts of the General</ins> Assembly of the Church of Scotland, of that year. The descriptions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span>
are so minute as to establish the identity of all the
volumes which are still extant. The attestation of the Clerk
is superscribed at the beginning, and subjoined to the end of
the first volume, in these words:&mdash;‘This is the great Volume
aprovin be the General Assemblee at Glascow, in November,
1638. A. Jhonston, Cl<sup>s</sup>. Eccl.’ The autograph of this Clerk
is to be seen on various documents in possession of the General
Assembly, and particularly on the copy of the printed Acts
of the Assembly of 1638, in the custody of the present Clerk.
The other volumes have the well known signature of a Clerk,
named ‘Thomas Nicolson.’</p>

<p>“It is understood, that, in 1649, the Books were transferred
to the charge of Mr Andrew Ker, Clerk of the Assembly;
and that, in 1652, most, if not the whole, of the originals were
for some time entrusted to Lord Balcarras. During the
troubles of the succeeding period they were concealed in the
house of a private individual till the year 1677, when they
were put into the hands of Bishop Paterson (of Edinburgh),
who retained them till after the Revolution. The account of
their discovery and subsequent fate may be seen in Keith’s
History of the Church and State of Scotland; but it appears
from a paper preserved in the Advocates’ Library in Edinburgh,
and published in the Appendix to Dr M‘Crie’s Lives
of William Veitch and George Brysson, that Keith’s narrative
is not altogether correct in every particular.</p>

<p>“After the Revolution some of the volumes and papers
were delivered up to a son of the former Clerk, Mr Secretary
Jhonston, who lent some of them to his cousin, Bishop Burnet,
and others to Mr George Ridpath, who, about that time,
undertook to write a history of Scottish affairs. Three volumes
fell into the hands of a person whose grandfather had
been the intimate friend of Sir Archibald Johnston, and had,
like him, been executed as a traitor. This person was the
Honourable and Reverend Archibald Campbell, grandson of
the Marquis of Argyle, and son of Lord Neil Campbell. Mr
Campbell was several years known as an Episcopalian Clergyman,
and subsequently as one of the non-juring Bishops in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_v"></a>[v]</span>
Scotland. During the latter part of his life he resided chiefly
in England, without being in communion with the Church of
England, and without maintaining any intercourse with the
Episcopalian body in Scotland, to which he had been originally
attached.</p>

<p>“About the year 1733, a correspondence was opened between
him and Mr William Grant, Procurator and Clerk of
the Church of Scotland (afterwards Lord Prestongrange),
on the subject of the records in Mr Campbell’s possession.
Mr Campbell offered to surrender these records on certain
terms, which did not appear to Mr Grant to be reasonable or
equitable. He demanded a large sum of money for the restitution
of the volumes to which he never had acquired any
right of property, and even this sum he would not accept till
the Books had been published, as was proposed, under his superintendence,
on the understanding that no member of the
Church of Scotland was to be suffered to revise the sheets as
they passed through the press.</p>

<p>“It could scarcely be expected that these and other humiliating
conditions would be acceded to without hesitation; and
while the negotiation was still in progress, Mr Campbell, as
he had sometimes threatened to do, took a step which was intended
to put the Books for ever beyond the reach of the
Church of Scotland, by entering into a deed of trust or covenant
with the President and Fellows of Sion College, the terms
of which do not appear to be accurately known to any member
of the Church of Scotland, but the effect of which has
undoubtedly been to detain these Records from their lawful
owners for nearly a century past.</p>

<p>“It is unnecessary to add, that the hardship is deeply felt
by all the members of the Church of Scotland, who are aware
of the importance of these Books, not merely as the only sure
and satisfactory memorials of the course of Ecclesiastical affairs
in the times immediately succeeding the Reformation, but also
because they are capable of shedding additional light on a
most interesting and instructive portion of our Civil history.</p>

<p>“In these circumstances, the General Assembly have deemed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
it necessary, as a last resource, to make an application
to Parliament by petition, in the hope that some means may
be devised by the wisdom of the Legislature, for relieving the
Members of Sion College from the restraint under which they
feel themselves, and enabling them to do that which they must,
as an act of justice, wish to do,&mdash;to restore to the Church of
Scotland these ancient Records, which, however acquired by
the College, the Church of Scotland still consider to be their
own property.</p>

<p class="p1">The authenticity and authority of “The Booke,” as now
for the first time fully printed from the copies in the Advocates’
Library, (so far as it exists in a continuous and connected
form,) becomes, since the originals are lost, a subject
of grave inquiry. It is our purpose, in the Notes and Illustrations
to be appended to the present Edition, to collect and
point out all the evidence attainable on this point&mdash;to supply
from other sources the portions which are wanting in the text&mdash;and
to note any seeming discrepancies among the several
transcripts and Abbreviates. This must necessarily be a work
of careful research and considerable labour; requiring some
time for its accomplishment. In the meanwhile, however, we
may state briefly some of the leading evidences of authenticity
on which we rely, in concluding, that what is now printed
possesses a character of authenticity.</p>

<p>1. The Acts of Assembly, 1638, and subsequent years,
(which are of unquestioned authenticity,) approve of, reiterate,
and re-enact many of the most important statutes contained in
the old Registers, which those Assemblies had in their possession;
and these, as re-enacted, coincide, so far as they go,
with the terms of the original Acts as now printed.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span></p>

<p>2. In Collier’s Ecclesiastical History of Great Britain, we
find a most important corroboration to the same effect. He
was a contemporary of Archibald Campbell, already referred to,
and had access to the original Registers recently burnt, as appears
from numerous marginal references to and quotations
from them. Thus (vol. ii. p. 700) he refers to “MS. Acts of
the Assembly, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">penes</i> Mr Archibald Campbell, Armig.;” and
there are very many other references to the same MS. record,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
as the source whence he derived numerous Acts and documents
embodied in his work. These, too, substantially and closely,
coincide with the text as now published.</p>

<p>3. Archbishop Spottiswood, in his History, (and he had full
access to the original records,) in like manner transfers many
extracts to his pages.</p>

<p>4. Bishop Keith, in his History of the Church and State
in Scotland, incorporates a great portion of the “Booke,”
during the first seven years of the existence of the Reformed
Church&mdash;all agreeing (except trifling variations in orthography)
with the extant MS. Abbreviates; and Knox’s History coincides
substantially with Keith’s.</p>

<p>5. But David Calderwood, who had full access to the Registers,
in his larger History and Collections, (MS.) gives the
most ample transcripts from the originals that are any where
to be found; and he further supplies many particulars from
those Registers which the Abbreviates do not contain, but
which are of material importance to the elucidation of the proceedings
in the Assemblies of the Church.</p>

<p>6. Petrie, in his History of the Church (Universal) from
600 to 1600, embodies a very great portion of the Booke of
the Kirk from the first Assembly downwards; and he refers
expressly, as his authority for so doing, to “An <cite>Extract</cite> of
the Acts of the Nationall Assemblies,” (p. 242,)&mdash;the Acts,
which he embodies very copiously, being identical in all respects
with those in the present Edition. The copy of his
work now before us was printed at the Hague in 1662, immediately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
after the Restoration of Charles II.;&mdash;Petrie being
“Minister of the Scots Congregation at Rotterdam,” when
his History was published. That work is one of the most conclusive
vouchers of the authenticity of the “Booke,”&mdash;his
transcripts being given from an Extract, authenticated, of
course, by the Clerk of Assembly.</p>

<p>We have thus, what is next to the best evidence (viz. the
Registers themselves) in support of the authenticity of our
publication&mdash;the concurrent testimony of three Episcopalian
and two Presbyterian Historians, in proof of the general
fidelity of the transcripts which remain; and the force of such
evidence is strengthened by the consideration, that all their
works were published while the originals were yet in existence,
and could have been resorted to for the correction of any errors,
whether wilful or accidental.</p>

<p>In justice to the Church of Scotland and to Dr Lee, the
Editor of this publication feels himself called on to add such
particulars with regard to the attempts made for the recovery
of the Registers, as are to be found in the recent Acts
of the General Assembly, within the last twenty years. Without
pretending to enter into any detail of the great and zealous
exertions of Dr Lee for the recovery of our Church Records,
(exertions for which it owes him a deep debt of gratitude,) we
shall merely note a few of the Minutes of the Assembly referable
to this matter since the year 1820.</p>

<p>At the Assembly of that year, the “Report of the Committee
upon the Manuscripts belonging to the Church [was]
called for, which was given in at great length by Dr Lee,
Convener of the said Committee. The Assembly highly approve
of the Report, and of the zeal and diligence of the Committee.
They renewed the appointment of the Committee,
and recommended to their attention the written Report now
laid upon the Assembly’s table.”&mdash;“Upon a motion, the unanimous
thanks of the Assembly were given from the chair to
Dr Lee, for the extraordinary labour to which he had submitted
in prosecuting the inquiries of the Committee.”</p>

<p>The year following a similar approval took place; and in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span>
1822, the Assembly “renewed the appointment of the Committee,
and direct them to continue their labours; and in particular,
they authorised them to continue their correspondence
with the members of Sion College, respecting access to certain
manuscripts in the said College, formerly belonging to
the Church; and they direct the Moderator to convey to the
Lord Bishop of London an expression of the sense which they
entertain of his Lordship’s polite attention to the communication
made to him by the Committee on this subject.”</p>

<p>At the Assembly of 1823, the Committee was approved and
renewed; “and the Assembly instructed the Committee to
get printed what is usually called ‘The Book of the Universal
Kirk,’ if they shall find, upon inquiry, it can be done without
encroaching upon the funds of the Church.”</p>

<p>Passing over some of the intermediate years, we find in the
Acts of 1828, that the Report of the Committee on the MSS.
of the Church was called for, and given in by Dr Lee, the
convener. “The Assembly approve of the Report, and re-appoint
the Committee. It was moved, seconded, and unanimously
agreed to, that with a view to the recovery of the ancient
Records of this Church, which have long been deposited
in Sion College, London, a Petition be presented to both
Houses of Parliament, stating the claims of the Church to the
property of these volumes, and praying that, in the wisdom of
Parliament, some means may be devised, of securing either the
restitution of the originals, or at least a complete and authenticated
transcript of the whole. The draft of a Petition having
been produced, was approved, and ordered to be extended,
subscribed by the Moderator, and sealed with the seal of the
Church,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>In 1829, “it was moved, seconded, and unanimously agreed
to, that, in addition to the former Committee, which is hereby
renewed, the Assembly appoint a small Committee, to watch
over and prosecute the very important object of recovering the
interesting record, entitled ‘The Buik of the Universall Kirk
of Scotland,’ and to take what steps they may find necessary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
for this purpose. It was also moved, seconded, and unanimously
agreed to, that the Moderator be instructed to return
the thanks of the General Assembly to Dr Lee, for the great
and unwearied zeal, attention, and exertions which he has bestowed
on the subject of the MSS. of the Church, and in regard
to the claims made for the Records in Sion College.”</p>

<p>In 1833, the Committee was renewed, “with instructions
to use their best endeavours to find accommodation for the
Books and MSS. belonging to the Church under the roof of
St Giles’s Church, if possible; and to use all diligence to recover
the Records in Sion College.” And in the Assembly of 1834,
Dr Lee, as convener, on giving in its Report, stated, “That
there is now a near prospect of obtaining the restitution of the
three volumes of the early records of the Church, which have
long been deposited in the library of Sion College.”</p>

<p>Only a few days previously to this favourable report being made,
(viz. May 2, 1834,) the Assistant Librarian of Sion College,
who had been summoned by a Committee of the House of
Commons, appeared before it, and was ordered to produce the
Books. On the 5th he produced them&mdash;Dr Lee, Principal
Macfarlan, and others, having previously, in April, inspected
and borne evidence to their authenticity.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> They were burnt
on the 16th of October following.</p>

<p>It were idle now to indulge in unavailing regrets and reflections
on this unfortunate result; and the present attempt is
made, in as far as that is possible, to repair the loss which has
thus been sustained by the Church and the country. We take
the liberty of deducing a practical inference from this calamity&mdash;that
no time should be lost in securing for the remaining
Records of the Church a place of safe deposit. This
surely is attainable in the metropolis of Scotland; and we
trust it will be one of the first acts of the ensuing General
Assembly, to adopt the requisite measures for this purpose, and
to order the List of MSS. in the repositories of the Church<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span>
(which was given in by Dr Lee some years ago) to be printed,
for the information of all its members, before the Assembly
be dissolved.</p>

<p>We cannot conclude these notices more appropriately than
by transcribing the following testimony, borne by Dr Lee to
two distinguished Prelates of the Church of England, in connexion
with this subject, and subjoining an extract from one
of his admirable Reports:</p>

<p>“The late Bishop of London, now Archbishop of Canterbury,
and the present Bishop of London, through whom I
made many applications, did all that was in their power to
forward the object; and if their advice had been promptly
followed by the College, we would have had the Books in our
possession ten years ago. Indeed, the conduct of these Prelates
reflected on them the highest honour.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In concluding his Report to the Assembly in May 1820, in
reference to these ancient Registers of the Church, Dr Lee
thus remarks&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>“They exhibit the real character of the internal government of
this national church. They display the operation of the principles
by which the first Reformers and their immediate successors were
actuated. They demonstrate that these men were not more distinguished
by zeal for truth, than by loyalty to the head of the government,
attachment to true principles, (I do not say of toleration&mdash;for
that was a term which they certainly did not employ or approve)&mdash;of
religious liberty and civil subordination. They bear testimony
to the strictness and impartiality of ancient discipline. They vindicate
the character of those illustrious men whose names have been
unjustly aspersed, but who, both by their doctrines and their lives,&mdash;by
their unwearied exertions and their patient sufferings,&mdash;left
an example, not indeed of faultless excellence, but assuredly of the
most noble, magnanimous, and fearless adherence to the standards
of our constitution.</p>

<p>“These Registers also contain much that is capable of correcting
erroneous representations of historical facts with regard to the
internal state of the kingdom&mdash;the institutions, habits, and customs,
as well as the morals of the people, and the spirit which was most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span>
prevalent at particular periods in various districts of the land. They
prove, beyond all controversy, that our Reformers, instead of having
been at first actuated by an unrestrained spirit of innovation, were
rather, in some respects, disposed to retain too much than to reject
too much of the practices of the church from which they had separated,
and that this very circumstance prevented them from ever
attaining that independence at which they aimed. At the same
time, they prove, that from the very first moment, it was the determined
object of the leaders of the Reformation, to establish such
a Presbyterian Government, as was at last, with the utmost difficulty,
completed;&mdash;and that even when the name of bishop was introduced,
the persons holding that title sat in the General and Provincial
Assemblies in no higher rank than the humblest presbyter,
and in the Kirk-Sessions were named after the parochial minister,
under the designation of elder.</p>

<p>“In addition to all this it may be stated, that, though these documents
were less productive of instruction than they are, they well
deserve to be preserved with care, as the most venerable remnants
of a distant age&mdash;as the earliest annals of our infant church, as the
(almost sacred) relics&mdash;not of canonized saints indeed&mdash;but of confessors
and martyrs, who counted not their lives dear to them; and
who, when they thought it necessary, never shrunk from sealing
their testimony with their blood. And if I am again asked&mdash;What
is the use of attending to these perishing monuments of a period of
little refinement?&mdash;I have only to answer, that with all my antiquarian
propensities, and all my admiration of what is great and magnificent
in the works of art, and all my reprobation of the violence
which impelled some of our Reformers to demolish the solemn temples
which they considered as the shrines of idolatry, and the receptacles
of antichristian intruders,&mdash;I would much rather share in the
disgrace of these acts of violation, than destroy or deface one
shred or fragment of these frail memorials of despised and almost
forgotten worth, which bear the impress of zeal for piety and learning,
loyalty and patriotism, liberty and truth,&mdash;and which more
conspicuously than even the uplifted banner of the Covenant, present
the seal and superscription of glory to God, and good will to
man&mdash;peace to the church, and happiness to the state.”</p>

<p>The fear of God conceaved of his holy word, the naturall and
unfained Love we bear unto your G. the dewtie quhilk we owe unto
our Countrey, and terrible threatenings quhilk our God pronunces
against every realme and citie in the quhilks horrible crimes are
openly committed, and then be the Committers obstinatly defended,
compel us, an great part of your subjects, humbly to crave of your
G. upright and trew Judgement against sick persones as hes done
what in them lyes to kindle God’s wrath against this realme. The
impietie be them committed is so hainous and so horrible, that as
it was a fact most vyle and rare to be heard of within this realme,
principallie within the bounds of citie, so should we think ourselves
guiltie of the samen if negligently, or yet for worldly fear, we pass
it over with silence, and therefore your Grace may not think that
we require any thing. All that we crave, open malefactors condignly
to be punished, But that whilk God hes commanded us to
crave, and has also commanded your G. to give to every one of
your subjects; ffor be this Link hes God knitt together the Prince
and the people, That as he commands honor, fear, and obedience
to be given to the Powers established be him, so does he in express
words command and declare what thing the Prince aught unto the
subjects, To witt, that as he is the Minister of God his word, bearing
the Sword for vengeance to be taken on evil doers, and for the
defence of peaceable and quiet men, swa ought he to draw the
samen without all partialitie swa oft as in God his name he is required
thereto. Seeing so it is, Madame, that this crime so recently
committed, and that in the eyes of your haill realme now presently
assembled, is so hainous, ffor who heretofore hath heard within the
bounds of Edinburgh, ʒetts and houses under silence of night
bruised up, houses ryped, and that with hostilitie seeking ane woman,
as appeared, to oppress her:&mdash;Seeing, we say, this crime is so
hainous, That all godlie men fear not only God’s sair displeasure to
fall upon you and your whole realme, But also that sick libertie
breed contempt, and in the end seditione, if remeed in tyme be not
goodlie provyded, quhilk in our Judgement is possible, if severe
punishment be not execute for the cryme committed. Therefore,
we most humbly beseech your Grace that, all affection laid aside,
ye declare yourselfe so upright in this case that ye may give evident
demonstratione to all your subjects, that the fear of God,
joyned with the love of common tranquillitie, have principall seat
and dominion in your Grace’s heart. This further, Madam, of conscience<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
we speak, that as your G. in God his name does crave of
us obedience, quhilk to render in all things lawful we are most
willing, swa in the samen name doe we, the whole Professors of
Christ’s Evangell within this realme, crave of you and of your
Councill sharp punishment of this cryme, and for performance
thereof, that, without all delay, the principall actor of this most
hainous cryme, and the persewars of this pretended villanie may be
called before the Chief Justice of this realme to suffer ane assyse,
and to be punished according to the Lawes of the samen, and your

him as Principall, he offerit himself to minister, according to the
talent given him be God. The Kirk, hearing his complaint and
offer, ordainit the said Mr Johne to accept the office, who, in presens
of the Assemblie, accepted the same.</p>

<p>The said day, David Fergusone, Minister of Dumfermling,
declared in the publict Assemblie, That he had spoken to Paul
Methven, lately excommunicat, quhom he fand verie sorrowful for
his grievous offence committed be him in maner above rehearsed,

untill sick tyme as famous and unsuspect witnesses affirme the
same, or ellse both the parties confesse it: And in case that Probation
or Confession follow not, that the saids offenders be punished
as Fornicators.</p>

<p>Concerning the order of appellations, it was statute and ordained,
That if anie person find himself hurt be any sentence given be any
Ministers, Elders, or Deacons of the Kirk, It sall be lesume to the
persone so hurt to appeall to the Superintendant of the Diocie and
his Synodall Convention, within ten dayes next after; and the
said Superintendant sall take cognition whether it was weill appealed
or not, and give sentence thereupon; and if the Partie yitt
alleges himself hurt be the Superintendent and his Convention, it

<p class="p2 center fs80">TENOUR OF THE ARTICLES.</p>

<p>First, that it is thoght good, and alsweill conforme to the Act of
Parliament, immediately before the Queen’s Majestie’s arrival, promittit
as her Heiness owin Ordinance, with consent of her Nobilitie,
decreit and appointit after her Grace’s arrivall, Chryst’s Religion
be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de novo</i> established, ratified, and approved throughout
the whole Realme, and that all Idolatrie, especially the Masse, be
abolished over all; so that no other Face of Religion be permittit
or thoilit to be erectit.</p>

<p>And for this effect, that the Ministers be provydit decentlie with
an assurit appointment, where they sall receive their livings asweill
bygane as to come, and not to live as Beggers, as presentlie they
doe; and in lyk maner to desyre, and with all humilitie to requyre,
that the Transgressours againis the Ordinances, asweill from
tymes past as from this tyme foorth, might be punisched according
to the saids Lawes and Ordinances, and especially againis them
that contemnes and committis Inobedience againis the saidis Lawes,
in Aberdein, in the Carse of Gowrie, in Seafield, and in sundrie
uther places, as salbe specifiet.</p>

<p>After the forsaids Articles war notified and declared to my Lords
the Erles of Murray, Argyle, Glencarne, and to my Lord Secritar,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
being present, and send be the Quein’s Hieness to the Assemblie,
to know quhat things were proponit therein; thoght the saids Articles,
as they were conceivit, not so convenient to be proponit as
appertained, and therefor thoght it meitt to collect twa Heids
thereof, quhilk they themselves wald propone to the Quein’s Majestie;
quhilk Heids follow:</p>

<p>And first, they wold declare to her the good mynds and obedience
of them then assemblit.</p>

<p>And as tuiching the Estate of Religioun, seeing it tuitchit the
said Lords most especiallye, being members of the said Kirk, they
wold labour at her Grace’s hands, that the same might be observit
according to the ordour establishit at her Heiness arryvall, and
doubtit not to obtaine sick gentle answer and agreement of her
Majestie in that behalf as might satisfie the said Assemblie.</p>

<p>The uther Heid, tuiching the sustentatioun of the Ministers, the
saids Lords in lyke maner promised to labour at her Hienes’ hands
that they might have appointment of the saids Stipends, and hoped
to dresse her Hienes so that they sauld be ressonablie satisfiet of
their desyre in that point.</p>

<p>Thereafter the saids Lords declarit, be the mouth of my Lord
Secretaire, how they had proponit the saids Heids to the Quein’s
Majestie, and how they were not only accepted be her Heiness in
good part, but also gentlie answerit, and acceedit to the performance
thereof; and therefore the saids Lords promised, in her Majestie’s
name, to the haill Assemblie, the accomplishment of the
saids desyres, of the quhilk they need not in any wayes to doubt;
for if they had been surely persuadit in their owin hearts that her
Hienes had meant utherwayes nor they had declared, her Grace sauld
have found uther Messengers then they to have shawin the same in
her Hienes’ name. Quhilk being be them declared, the haill number
present first thanked God and her Majestie, that their reassonable
desyres were so generallie answerit; and for recognoscing of their
owin dutie, desyrit the saids Lordis reciprocallie to promise to her
Majestie, in their behalf, all duetifull obedience, love, and submission,
quhilk can be lookit for be any Christian Prince of most
faithfull, humble, and loving subjects; promiseing therewithall, if
any of their number sould happen to forget the duetie of a good
Subject, or offendes her Majestie’s Lawes, that they all afaldlie
wold concurre to the punition of the offendour, according to the
qualitie of that trespass, as they sould be commandit.</p>

Intromissioun as prices of Teynds, he promises to fulfil the same,
so that the pure labourers sould feile at his hands ease and support
within his Rowmes.</p>

<p>In lyk maner my Lord of Murray was content, and for his teynds
within Fyfe, namit the Laird of Lundie, that sall modifie either
money or victuall.</p>

<p>Aleso Alexander Bischop of Galloway promised to doe [the lyke]

<p>Anent the requeist of Mr Patrick Couston, minister of Syres,
desyreing the licence to pass to France and other countreyis, for

out of this countrey, nor yet leave his congregatioun quher he travels
without speciale licence of the haill Kirk, if they sall heirafter
think it expedient or necessarie.</p>

to doe and fulfill.</p>

<p>Touching his desyre to delate his proces of their books, thereto
the Clark can noways condescend, neither think they that sick ane
petition can proceed from the Holy Ghost, seeing David, ane notable
servant of God, eschewed not to write his owne offence to
God’s glory and his own confusione. Anent his admission to the
ministrie within the realme, that was thought no wayes sufferable
unto sic tyme as the memorie of his former impietie be more deeplie
buried, and some notable Kirk within this realme make earnest request
for his new acceptation; and likewise the Kirk signifies unto
him, that his entry in the ministrie in the parts of England, he
being excommunicat and unreconciled, hes grievously offended
them; as also the last part of his writeing, where he accuses false<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>

with his mouth in write. Farder, the Assembly required the
brethren to whom the said Paull hes written, that amongst uthers
their answers they signifie unto him that he may safelie repare toward
this realme, notwithstanding lately proclaimed against adulterers.</p>

<p>Touching sic as are relapse the third tyme in any kinde of cryme,
sic as fornication and drunkenness, it is statute and ordained, that
no particular minister admitt sic persones to repentance, but to send
them to the Superintendant of the diocie where the crymes are
committed, with information, who shall give them sic injunctions
as they think may make the offence to be holden in horror. But
chiefly that they compell the offender to satisfie the Kirk where
the offences were made moe dayes nor ane, as the Superintendant

<p>Thirdlie, That none be permitted to have charge of Schooles,
Colledges, or Universities, or yet privately or publickly to instruct
the youth, but such as shall be tryed be the Superintendents or
visitors of the Church, sound and able in doctrine, and admitted
be them to their charges.</p>

<p>Fourthlie, For sustentation of the poor, that all lands founded to
hospitalitie of old be restored agane to this same use, and that
all lands, annualrents, or any other emoluments pertaining any
ways to the friers of whatsumever ordour, or annualrents, altarages
pertaining to Priests, be applyed to the sustentatione of the
poor, and uphald of Schooles in the towns and uthers places where
they ly.</p>

<p>Fifthly, That horrible crymes as now abounds in the realme
without any correction, to the great contempt of God and his holy
word, sic as idolatrie, blaspheming of God’s name, manifest breaking
of the Sabbath Day, witchcraft, sorcerie, and inchantment,
adulterie, incest, manifest whoredome, maintainance of Brodells,
murther, reiffe, slaughter and spulzie, with many uther detestable
crymes, may be severely punished, and judges appointed in every
province or diocie for the executione thereof, with power to doe
the same, and that be act of Parliament.</p>

<p>Last, That same order be devysed and established for the ease
of the poor laborers of the ground concerning the unreasonable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
payment of their teynds, taken over their heads without their advyse
and consent.</p>

<p>The same day the Lairds of Carnall, Sornebeg, and Dreghorne,
requesting humblie for support of a ministerie for their kirks of
Rickartoune and Dundonald in Kyle, promised of their awn free
will that they should provide stipends sufficient according as the
Kirk would appoint, and that they should not remove from their
Kirks for seeking payment of the samen; whilk request of theirs
the haill Kirk praised, and promised satisfaction to their godlie
desyre.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sess. 3, Junii 27, 1565.</p>

<p>Anent the question proponed, whether Children may contract
Marriage, and Marrie without consent of their Parents, and in
speciall, whether the promise made betwixt Robert Patersone and
Jonet Little, without the consent of the parents, may stand or
not; it is found that the said Robert and Jonet hes not orderly proceeded
in the said promise of marriage, in so far as they neither
obtained the consent of the parents, nor yet, be the late order,
repared to the Kirk of God to lament their cause, and seek the
ordinary means thereat, be the word of God appointed: and
therefore the Commissioners appointed be the Kirk for decision of
Questions, determines that they have not lawfully proceeded in
making of the said promise of marriage, and they should of dutie
thus have proceeded: First, to require the consent of the parents,
whilk being refused, then to make the sute unto the Kirk, to concurre
with them in their lawfull proceedings, according to the order
observed in God’s word; and for the offence and unlawfull proceeding
bypast, to make satisfaction to the Kirk, as they shall be
appoynted thereto: and hereupon ane general order to be set forth,
as the Generall Assemblie shall think good to be observed, in all
particular Kirks in tyme comeing. This was subscryved be the
Commissioners underwritten:&mdash;Mr John Dowglass, Rector of the
Universitie of St Andrews, Christopher Goodman, George Buchanan,
John Craig, Minister, John Row, Robert Pont.</p>

<p>Ane uther question, whether ane learned man, having an benefice
given in papistie, or lately since the word has been preached
in this realme, may leave the parochine where he is persone, destitute
of preaching the word, and enter Minister to serve in ane
uther place for larger stipend? The foresaid Commissioners concluded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
as follows: It is thought agreeable to the word of God that
no faithfull preacher of God’s word may enjoy any benefice or living
pertaining to the Kirk, except he remaine at the said Kirk to
discharge his office, for the whilk he receaved the said benefice;
and that if he be transported be the Kirk or Superintendant to any
uther place whereby he may not discharge his duty in both, That he
be depryved of the ane, and it to be bestowed upon ane uther; provyding
always, the foresaid persone be sufficiently answered of his
stipend.</p>

<p>Ane uther question, whether if any man abusing his Cusings, his
father’s brother’s daughter, seven years, and begottin children, and
presently maried, marry her, and underly conviction, may marry or
not? The degrees are second of Consanguinitie.</p>

<p>Though this be not found contrary to the word of God, yet because
it has not been publickly revealed in this realme, and that
diverse inconvenients are perceaved to insue of this Liberty,
thinks it good that it be referred to the Civil Magistrates, or else to
ane Parliament, for order to be taken therein, and that in the
meantime, men take not libertie to their senses according to their
filthie affections, not the lesse that the persons in whose name this
question was proponed be joyned in marriage, after their publick
repentance for the offences bygone, without any hope that uthers
hold the like license, while farder order be taken be the Civill
Magistrate, as said is.</p>

<p>Anent the complaint given in be the Superintendant of Fyfe,
touching the wanting of a preacher at the Kirk of Kylmeny, pertains
as ane common Kirk to St Salvator’s College in St Andrewes; Mr
John Rutherfurd, Provest, and Mr William Ramsay, one of the
Ministers, was content that the Superintendants of Angus and
Fyfe, Christopher Goodman and Mr George Buchanan, should consider
this Complaint, and whatsoever they decyded therein, and
ordained to be done therein, they should fulfill the same in sic sort
that nae complaint should be heard hereafter.</p>

<p>Ane Complaint was given in be the Parochiners of Tunninghame
who payes the Teynds to the New College of St Andrews, and
has no preaching nor ministration of Sacraments. Mr John Dowglas,
Rector of the Universitie, and Master of the said College,
promised to the Kirk to satisfie the Complainers reasonably, that
hereafter the Kirk shall not be troubled with farther Complaint.</p>

<p>The haill Assemblie, with ane voyce and minde, choose John

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>The Queen’s Majestie’s Answers.</em></p>

<p>To the first, desyring the masse to be suppressed and abolished,
alsweill in the head as in the members, with ane punishment against
the contraveeners, as also the religion now professed to be established
be an Act of Parliament; it is answered, first, for the part
of her Majestie’s self, that her heiness is no wayes yet persuaded
in the said religion, nor yet that any impietie is in the masse; and,
therefore, believes that her loving subjects will no wayes preisse her
to receave any religion against her own conscience, quhilk should bring
her to perpetuall trouble be remorse of conscience, and therewith
ane perpetuall unquietness; and, to deall plainly with her subjects,
her Majestie neither may nor will leave the religion wherein she has
been nourished and upbrought, and believes the samen to be well-grounded,
knowing, besydes, the grudge of conscience if she should
receive any change in her owne religione, that she should tyne the
friendship of the King of France, the ancient allya of this realme,
and of other great Princes, her friends and confederats, who would
take the same in evil part, and of whom she may lake for great support
in all her necessities; and having no consideration that may
counterweigh the same, she will be loath to put in hazard the loss of
all her friends in ane instant; praying all her loveing subjects, seeing
they have had experience of her goodness, that she neither has
in tymes past, nor yet means hereafter, to preasse the consciences of
any man, but that they may worship God in sic sort as they are
persuaded to be best, that they also will not preasse her to offend her
own conscience.</p>

<p>As for establishing religion in the body of the realme, they themselves
know, as appears well be their Articles, that the same cannot
be done be only the consent of her Majestie, but reqyres necessarly
the consent of the three Estates of Parliament; and, thereafter, so
soon as the Parliament holds, that whilk the three Estates agrees
upon among themselves, her Majestie shall grant the same to them,
and alwayes make them sure that no man shall be troubled for useing
themselves in religion according to their conscience, so that no
man shall have cause to doubt that, for religion’s sake, many lyves
or heritages shall be in hazard.</p>

<p>To the second article it is answered, that her Majestie thinks it
no way reasonable that she should defraud herselfe of so great a
part of the patrimony of her crowne, as to put the patronages of
benefices furth of her own hands; for her own necessitie in bearing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
of her great and common charges will require the retention of ane
good parte in her own hands. Nottheless, her Majestie is well
pleased that consideratione being had of her own necessitie, and
what may be sufficient for her, and for the reasonable sustentatione
of the ministers, ane speciall assignatione be made to them in places
most commodious to them, with the whilk her Majestie shall not intromitt,
but suffer the same come to them.</p>

<p>To the third article, her Majestie shall doe therein as shall be
agreed be the Estates in Parliament.</p>

<p>To the fourth article, her Majestie’s liberality towards the poor
shall be alse far extended as can be reasonably required at her
hands.</p>

<p>To the fifth article, her Majestie will referr the taking order with
that and alse of the sixth article to the Parliament.</p>


<p class="p1 center">The answers of the Kirk to thir above written <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>First, Where her Majestie answers, That she is not persuaded in
religion, neither that she understands any impietie in the masse,
but that the same is well grounded, that is no small grief to the
Christian hearts of her godly subjects; considering that the trumpet
of Christ’s Evengell hes been so long blowne in the countrey,
and his mercy so plainly offered in the same, that her Majestie remains
yet unpersuaded of the truth of this her religione; for our
religion is not else but the same religion quhilk Jesus Christ hes in
the last days revealed frae the bosome of his Father, whereof he
made his Apostles messengers, and quhilk they preached and established
among his faithfull, till the ’gaincoming of our Lord Jesus
Christ; quhilk differs from the impietie of the Turks, the blasphemy
of the Jews, the vaine superstitione of the Papists, in this, that only
our religion hes God the Father, his only Sone Jesus Christ, our
Lord, his Holy Spirit speaking in his Prophets and Apostles, for
authors thereof, and their doctrine and practise for the ground of
the same: the quhilk no uther religion upon the face of the earth
can justly alleadge or plainly prove; yea, whatsomever assurance
the Papists hes for their religion, the same hes the Turks for maintainance
of their Alcorane, and the Jews fare greater for defence of
their ceremonies, whether it be antiquitie of tyme, consent of people,
authorietie of princes, great number or multitude consenting
together, or any uther sicklyke cloaks they can pretend; and,
therefore, as we are dolorous that her Majestie in this our religione<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
is not persuaded, most reverently we require, in the name of the
Eternall God, that her heines would embrace the means whereby she
may be persuaded of the truth whilk presently we offer unto her
Grace, aleswall be preaching of the Word, whilk is the chief means
appointed be God to persuade all his chosen children of his infallible
veritie, as be publick disputation against the adversaries of this
our religion, deceavers of her Majestie, whensoever it shall be
thought expedient to her Grace. And, as to the impietie of the
Masse, we dare be bold to affirme that in that idoll there is a great
impietie; from the beginning to the ending, it is nothing else but a
masse of impietie; the author, or sayers, the action itselfe, or
opinion thereof concerned, the hearers and gazers upon it, avows
sacrilege, pronounces blasphemie, and committs most abominable
idolatrie, as we have ever offered and yet offers ourselfes, most
manifestly to prove. And where her Majestie esteems that the
change of religion should dissolve the confederacy of allyance that
she hes with the King of France and uther princes; assuredlie
Christ’s trew religion is the undoubted meane to knitt us surely,
perfyte confederacie and friendship with him that is King of kings,
and who hes the hearts of all princes in his hands, whilk ought to
be more precious to her Majestie nor the confederacie of all princes
of the earth, without the whilk neither confederacie, love, nor kindness,
can indure.</p>

<p>Concerning her Majestie’s answer to the second article: Whereas,
she thinks it nowayes reasonable to defraud her self of the patronage
of benefices, whilk her Majestie esteems to be ane part of
her patrimonie, and that her Majestie be minded to retain a good
part of the benefices in her own hands to support her common
charges:</p>

<p>As to the first point, [it is not our meaning,] that her Majestie
or any uther patrone within this realme should be defrauded of
their just patronages. But we meane, whensoever her Majestie or
any uther patrone does present any persone to a benefice, that the
persone presented should be tryed and examined be the judgement
of learned men of the Kirk, sick as are presently the Superintendants
appointed thereto; and as the presentation of benefices pertains
to the patrone, so ought the collatione thereof, be law and
reasone, appertaine to the Kirk: of the whilk collatione the Kirk
should not be defrauded more than the patrones of their presentatione;
for utherwayes it shall be leasume to the patrone, absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
to present whomsoever they please, without tryall or examination:
what then can abide in the Kirk of God but ignorance without all
order?</p>

<p>As to the second point, concerning the retentione of ane good
part of the benefice in her Majestie’s own hands: This poynt abhors
so far from good conscience, alsweill of God’s law as frae the publick
order of our common lawes, that we are loath to open up the
ground of the matter be any long circumstances; and therefore we
most reverently wishe that her Majestie would consider the matter
with her selfe and her wise counsell, That howsoever the patronages
of benefices may appertaine to herself, or the retention thereof
in her own hands undisponed to qualified persons, is both ungodly,
and alse contrare to all publick order, and brings noe small confusione
to the poor soules of the common people, who be these meanes
should be instructed of their salvatione. And where her Majestie
concludes, in the second answer, that she is content that ane sufficient
and reasonable sustentatione of the ministers be provided to
them, be assignationes in places most commodious to them, consideration
being had of her own necessitie; as we are desirous that
her Grace’s necessitie be relieved, so our dewtie craves, that we
should notifie to her Grace, the trew order that should be observed
to her in this behalfe, whilk is this: The teinds are properly to be
reputed to be the patrimonie of the kirk, upon the whilks, before
all things, they that travells in the ministrie thereof, and the poor
indigent members of Christ’s body, ought to be sustained; the
kirks also repaired, and the youth brought up in good letters:
whilks things being done, then wher necessitie reasonablie might
be supported, according as her Grace and her godly counsell thinks
expedient: allwayes we cannot but thank her Majestie most reverently
of her liberall offer of assignation to be made to the ministers
for their sustentation, whilk not the less is so generally conceaved,
that without more speciall condescending upon the particulars
thereof, no executione is likelie to follow thereon; and so
to conclude with her Majestie at this present, We desyre most
earnestly the saids ministers’ articles to be reformed, beseiking God
that as they are reasonable and godlie, so her Grace’s heart and
the Estates presently conveened may be inclined and persuaded to
the performance thereof.</p>

Christ Jesus and his holy Evangell within this realme, in name and
behalfe of our ministers, exhorters, and readers; That where oft
and diverse tymes promise hes been made unto us that our saids
brethren, preachers and travellers in the kirk of God, should not
be defrauded of their appointed stipends, neither yet should be in
any wayes molested in their functions, yet notthelesse universallie

he shall have of ane reasonable life in tyme to come: Our maist
humble request is therefore unto your Majestie, that our ministers
may be payed of their bygone stipend, that sic as have receaved
assignationes thereof from the former collectors may have execution
of their assignation, that your Grace pleases to appoint them the
assignation promised in your Hienes last answers to the petitiones

<p>Anent the question, Whether any man might marry his wife’s
brother daughter, or his wife’s sister daughter, or what order should

<p>Anent the complaint given in be the Superintendant of Lowthiane,
against Mr Patrick Craicke, minister of Ratho, for marrying of
Robert Patersone and Jonat Little, in Dummaine kirk, neither the
bands being proclaimed, nor yet satisfactione made to the Kirk of
Edinburgh, according to the tenor of the decreet of the last Assemblie:</p>

<p>The said Mr Patrick granted publickly that he had offended, and
submitted himself to the correction of the kirk. Therefore, be the
haill Assembly, he was ordained to satisfie the will of the Kirk of
Edinburgh, upon two severall Sundayes, be his own open confession,
when the said Kirk of Edinburgh shall require him, and the
third Sunday to satisfie the kirk of Dummainie, where the offence
was committed; suspending for this present all farther correction,
in hope of his better bearing in tyme to come.</p>

<p>The haill Assembly, with one voyce, statutes and ordaines, That
no ministers hereafter receave the parochiners of ane uther parochine
to be married, without ane sufficient testimoniall of the minister of
the parochine wherefrae they came, that the bands are lawfullie proclaimed,
and no impediment found, so that the order that has been
taken be the kirk, in sic affaires, be dewlie observed under the paine
of deprivation frae his ministrie, tinsell of his stipend, and uther
paines, as the Generall Kirk shall hereafter think to be imponed.</p>

against John Melvill, minister of Carraill, alleadgeand the said
John to proceed to the solemnizatione of marriage betwixt Robert
Arnot and Euphame Corstorphine, notwithstanding ane uther woman
claimes the said Robert: The haill Kirk Assemblie ordained
ane inhibitione to pass against the said John, that he on nowayes

Rector of the Universitie, and Mr James Wilkie, Regent, hear the
complaints to be given in be the said Superintendant, and alse be

<p class="p1 center">Sessio 4<sup>ta</sup>, December 28, 1565.</p>

<p>Mr John Furde, Minister of Dummanie, is ordained to satisfy, as
is before sett downe in the 3d Session, anent Mr Patrick Craicke,
for his offence, specifiet in the Act of the first Session, suspendand
the said John from all function of the ministrie, in the meantime,
whill the compleating of the said satisfaction, and thereafter to returne
to his vocation of ministrie.</p>

<p>It was asked if it be lawfull that ane minister, what title or honor
ever he bear, receiving sufficient benefite and provisione off his
flock, may leave them, and make his common residence in uther
places, sae that his flock is destitute alswell of his doctrine and ministrie,
as of uther comforts that the flock should receave of ane
faithfull pastor&mdash;notwithstanding that worldly reasons may seem to
excuse the absence of some? The answer; No minister of the
Evangell of Jesus Christ, nor no persone receiving sufficient living for
preaching of the Evangell, may, with safe conscience, leave his vocatione,
together with his flock, and the place appointed for his ordinarie
residence, what patrimonie and oversight that ever he hes,
be corruption of tymes, or negligence of rulers, so to doe.</p>

<p>If sic as hes entred in the ministrie, been appointed be the Superintendants,
and received of the people, may leave their vocation
and follow the world, because they have not sufficient stipend?
Answer: Seeing that our Master Christ Jesus pronounces that
he is but ane mercenarie, who, seeing the wolf coming, fleeth for his
own safeguard, and that the very danger of lyfe cannot be ane excuse
for sic as shall fall back from Christ, we nowayes think it lawfull
that sic as ance put their hands to the plough shall leave the
heavenly vocation and return to the prophane world, for indigence
or povertie; lawfully they may leave ane unthankfull people, and
seek where Jesus Christ his Evangell may bring forth better fruit;
but lawfully they may never change their vocation.</p>

<p>If known murtherers, or convict adulterers, together with sic as
committ horrible crymes, may not, upon the notorietie of their fault,
be once denounced excommunicat, for declaration that the Kirk
abhors sic impietie? Answer: The Kirk may and ought to purge
herself of all sic notorious malefactors, provyding the offender be
lawfully called and convict, either be their owne confessione or be
witnesses. The order to call them for the sclander (for civil things
we remitt to the magistrates) we judge to be this: Whensoever sic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
fearfull crymes are committed, if it be in the countrie, the minister,
reader, or exhorter of that place, or if there be none, the minister
of the place next adjacent, ought to give notice of the fact to the
Superintendant of that diocie, who, without delay, ought to direct
his summonds, charging the persons sclandered to compear before
him at a certain day and place; or if it be done in towns where
order is established, the Session thereof ought to call the accused
offenders, who, if they compeir, and either alleadge just defense, or
show themselves unfainedly penitent, then must the Superintendant,
or Minister and Kirk without the Superintendant, dispense somewhat
with the rigour of the punishment, secluding only the offender
fra participation of the sacraments till farder tryall of his repentance,
and that both their diligence and sentence to be publickly
pronounced in the kirks where the offence is known. But if
the offender be stubborne, as if he compeir not, or shew himself
little touched with his offence, then ought the Superintendant, with
advyce of the next reformed Kirk, to decerne him or them to be
secluded from participatione of communione with the faithfull members
of Jesus Christ, and to be given to Satan for the destruction
of the fleshe, whoes slaves (be impietie committed and impenitence
showen) they declare themselves to be; and their sentence to be
published in all places where the offence is knowne. If the person
or persons secluded from the sacrament be negligent in seeking
reconciliation with the Kirk, behave themselves insolently or utherwayes
then it becomes penitent persones, the Kirk, after admonitione,
may proceed to the uttermost; for wanton behaviour, after
iniquitie committed, is ane plaine argument of impenitence, and negligence
to seek reconciliation declares that contempt lurks in the
heart.</p>

<p>If baptisme administrat be ane papist priest, or in the papisticall
manner, shall be reiterat? When sic children comes to years of
understanding, they should be instructed in the doctrine of salvatione,
the corruption of the papistrie might be declared unto them,
whilk they most publickly damne, before they be admitted to the
Lord’s table; whilks if they doe, there needs not the externall signe
to be reiterat; for no papist ministers baptisme without water and
some forme of words, whilks are the principalls of the externall
signe; we ourselves were baptized be papists, whose corruptions
and abuses now we damne, cleaveing only to the simple ordinance
of Jesus Christ, and to the veritie of the Holy Spirit, whilk makes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
baptisme to work in us be proper effects thereof, without any declaration
of the externall signe. If sic children come never to the
knowledge of trew doctrine, they are to be left to the judgement of
God.</p>

<p>What order ought to be used against sic as oppress children? As
concerning punishment, the civill magistrate ought therein to decerne.
As touching the sclander, the offenders ought to be secluded
from participation of the sacraments whill they have satisfied the
Kirk, as they shall be commanded.</p>

<p>What punishment shall be used against them that ly in fornication
under promise of marriage, whilk they deferr to solemnizat,
and to satisfie be publick repentance for the sclander given?
Answer: Alsewell the man as the woman should be publickly
[admonished] in the place of repentance; Likewise satisfie on ane
Sunday before that they be married.</p>

that every brother speak with such modestie and measure as becometh
the ministers of God’s word to doe, with consent of the haill
Assembly, John Erskine of Dunn, Knight, Superintendant of Angus
and Merns, was continued Moderator, who was content for the present
to use the samen office.</p>

<p>Ordaines that some of the brethren, in name of the haill Kirk,

honors, unto the tyme they be reconciled to the Kirk, chiefly when
excommunication is notour and objected againes.</p>

<p>Anent the supplication presented to this Assembly be Robert
Commendator of Haly-rude-house, showing in effect, how it was
not unknowne to their wisdomes, That he had diverse godly learned
men of his owne place of Halyrudehouse, sic as Alexander Forrester
and Peter Blackwood, who are men of good conversation and
literature, were admitted and receaved be the Kirk to the ministrie,
and how he had diverse kirks pertaining to the Abbacie, as the
kirks of Tranent and St Cuthbert’s, and alleadged that most decent
and convenient it were, that his said kirks should be served be the
servants of the said Abbay: Herefore, requested most earnestly
that the Kirk presently assembled should transport Mr Thomas
Cranstoune and William Harlaw, now ministers of his said kirks,
and place them at some uther kirks, as should be thought good be
the haill Assembly to appoint them, and to place his saids servants
at his saids kirks as ministers, there to be served be them in tyme
comeing; as in the said request at length was contained.</p>

<p>The Kirk haveing ryply considered the said supplication and
advysed thereupon, caused call before them some of the elders of
the said parochines, and diligently inquired if they had any fault to
lay against their ministers, or if they would be content they should
be transported from them? Answer was given, that they had no
cryme nor fault to lay against their ministers, but was better content
with them then they would be with any uther that would be
presented to them; and attour, on no wayes would be content that
any of them should be transported from them: Therefore, the Kirk
presently assembled on no wayes condescended to the transportation
of them, for the reasons foresaid; But brotherly requested the
said Lord Commendator to provide for some godly ministers for
uthers of his kirks whilks are destitute of preaching of the true
word of God, the speciall food of their souls, which they doubt not
but his Lordship will doe, for discharge of his own conscience.</p>

1564, of the estate of the answers thereto frome the said
Assembly, of his long and tedious journey out of England to Scotland,
and impediments that chanced him in the way; finally requests
for ane of thir two, That is, either to suspend excommunication
of the Kirk for ane tyme, and receave him in the fellowship
of the same as ane poor sheep, upon ane condition, wherever he
chances to be, upon half ane year’s warning, he shall be bound to
returne againe at command of the Kirk, and obey sic injunctions
as they would command him to doe; or if the Kirk pleased not this
petition, then to committ his answer to such as the Kirk should
appoint, who’s judgement and determination (as his body might
bear) he promised be God’s grace to obey; Finally, all counsell
that have followed heretofore, and himself most humbly, he submitted
to the judgement of the present Assembly; as in the said supplication
at length was contained: Last of all, it was ordained that he
present himself personally before the Assembly; and being entered,
prostrate himself before the haill brethren with weeping and howling,
and commanded to ryse, might not expresse farther his request,
being, as appeared, so farr troubled with anguish of heart, was desyred
to be of good comfort, and to depart to his lodgeing whill
order were taken anent his request. And forsuameikle as in the
said Assembly holden in Edinburgh in December 1564, it was concluded
to receave him to repentance, now rested to conclude upon

Ministers, and Commissioners of Shyres, Towns, and
Kirks: The invocatione of God’s name made be Mr John
Craig, Minister of Edinburgh.</p>
</div>


<p>In the first, for order to be observed in reasoning, and that every
brother speak to his purpose, with sic measure as it becomes the
ministers of God’s word to doe, John Eskine of Dunn, Superintendant
of Angus and Mernes, was continued Moderator, whereof he
was content.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sess. 2<sup>a.</sup> December 26, 1566.</p>

<p>Anent the Assignation of the pensione of money and victualls offered
be the Queen’s Majestie, and her most honourable Councill,
for the sustentation of ministers within this realme, the haill brethren
present, required the ministers being in the Sessione, to pass
furth of the Assembly, and with mature deliberation to consult and
advyse, whether they think good to accept the same for reliefe of
the present necessitie or not.</p>

<p>After long reasoning and mutual conference anent the said Assignation,
returning againe in, the Assembly thought it good, for support
of the ministers’ necessitie, to accept the said offer of money
and victuall, if they might be gotten hastilie; nottheless, in consideratione
of the law of God, Ordaines the persones who heares the
doctrine of salvatione at the mouthes of his ministers, and thereby<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
receaves speciall food to the nowrishment of their soules, to communicat
temporall sustentation on their preachers: Their answer is,
That having just title to crave the bodilie food at the hands of the
saids persons, and finding no uthers bound unto them, they only require
at their own flock, that they will sustain them according to
their bounden dutie, and what it shall please them to give for their
sustentation, if it were but bread and water, neither will they refuse
it, nor desist from the vocatione. But to take from others contrare
their will, whom they serve not, they judge it not their dewtie,
nor yet reasonable; alwayes they most heartily thank the Lords
that bestowed their labours and paines in purchasing the foresaid
assignatione, most heartily requesting their honours to persevere,
whill they bring it to some perfectione. Nevertheless, the
haill Assemblie solemnly protested that the acceptance of the foresaid
assignatione for the relief as said is, prejudges not the libertie
of the kirk to sute for that thing that justly pertaineth to the patrimonie
of the same, in tyme and place convenient, in any tyme
hereafter.</p>

<p>The same day were proponed thir questions underwritten, and
answers thereto as follows:&mdash;Whether if the teyndes properly pertaines
to the kirk, and should only be applyed to the ministers, sustentatione
of the poor, maintainyng of schools, repairing of kirks, and
uthers godly uses, at the discretion of the kirk?</p>

<p>Answered affirmative, without contradiction.</p>

<p>Secondly, If the teynds pertains to the Kirk, and ought and
should be imployed to sic godly uses as said is, Whether, if
the ministers, who are the mouth of the Kirk, may, with safe
conscience, keep silence, seeing the patrimonie of the Kirk maist
injustly taken up and wasted in vain things, be sic persons as bears
no office in the Kirk of God; and, in the meantyme, the ministers
ceisand for necessitie, the poor perishing for hunger, the schools
decayand, and kirks falland to the ground?</p>

<p>Answered: They ought not to keep silence, but earnestly to admonische
every man of his deutie, and desyre all men to suit for
that whilk justly pertaines to the sustaining of the things forsaid.</p>

<p>Thirdly, Whether, if the Kirk may justly require of all possessors
the teynds to be paid to the Kirk only, and inhibite all uthers

shall be used be the Kirk against them?</p>

<p class="noindent">Witt your universities, That our loving brother, John Knox, bearer

the Evangell of Christ Jesus, within this realme of Scotland, continually
thir eight yeares bygone, or thereabout; in doctrine pure, and

that they would be content gently to handle the brethren

whilks appearantly tends more to superstitione nor edificatione;
and requests Mr Knox to put the heads in write whilks he
thinks necessare to be written to the saids Bishops; the tenor
whereof <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Superintendants, Ministers, and Commissioners of Kirks
within this Realme of Scotland, To their Brethren, the
Bishops and Pastors of Ingland, who hes renounced the Romane
Antichrist, and does professe with them the Lord
Jesus in sincerity, desyres the perpetual increase of the
Holy Spirit.</p>
</div>

<p>By word and write, it hes come to our knowledge, Reverend
Pastors, that diverse of our dearest brethren, amongst whom are
some of the best learned within that realme, are depryved from ecclesiasticall
sunshine and forbidden to preach, and so by you are
stayed to promove the Kingdome of Christ, because their conscience
will not suffer them to take upon them, at commandment of the
authoritie, sick garments as idolaters in tyme of blindnesse have used
in their idolatrie, whilk bruit cannot be bot most dolorous to our
hearts, mindfull of that sentence of the Apostle, saying, If ye byte
and devowre one another, take heid lest ye be consumed one of
another. We purpose not at this present, to enter into the ground
whilk we hear of aither partie, to be agitate with greater vehemencie
then well lyketh us, To witt, whether sic apparell is to be
counted amongst things simple and indifferent or not. But, in the
bowells of Christ Jesus, we crave that Christian charity may so prevaill
in you; in you, we say, the Pasters and leaders of the flock
in that realme, that ye doe not to uthers that quhilk ye would not
have uthers doe to you. Ye cannot be ignorant how tender a thing
the conscience of man is. All that have knowledge are not alyke
persuaded, yet conscience reclaims not at the wearing of sic garments,
but many thousands, both godly and learned, are utherwayes
persuaded, whose consciences are continually stricken with thir
sentences&mdash;What has Christ to do with Belial? What fellowshid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
is betwixt light and darkness? If surcloaths, cornet, cape, and tippet,
hes been badges of idolators in the very act of their idolatrie,
what hes the preacher of Christian libertie and the open rebuke of
all superstitione to doe with the dreggs of that Romish beast? Yea,
what is he that ought not to feare either to take in his hand or
forehead the print and mark of that odious beast? Our brethren
that of conscience refuses that unprofitable apparell does rather now
molest you that use sick vain trifles: if ye shall doe the like to them,
we doubt not but therein ye shall please God, and comfort the
hearts of many whilks are wounded with the extreamitie that is
used against these godly and our well-beloved brethren. Collour of
Rhetoric or manly persuasion will we use none, but charitablie we
desyre you to call that sentence of Peter to minde; Feed the flock
of God whilk is commited to your charge, caring for it, not be restraint
but willingly, not as though ye were lords over God’s heritage,
but that ye may be ensamples to the flock. And, farder, alse
we desire you to meditate on that sentence of the Apostle, saying,
Give nane offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Grecians, nor to
the Kirk of God. In what condition of tyme ye and we both travell
in the promoving of Christ’s Kingdome, we suppose you not
to be ignorant; and therefore we are more bold to exhort you to
walk more circumspectly then that for sick vanities the godly should
be troubled; ffor all things that may seeme lawful edifie not. Give
the commandment of the authoritie urge the conscience of you and
our brethren farther than they can bear, we unfainedly crave of
you that ye remember ye are called the light of the world, and the
salt of the earth. All civil authoritie hes not the light of God
alwayes shyning before their eyes in their statutes and commandments;
but their affections savour over meikle of the earth and of
worldly wisdome, and, therefore, wee think you should boldly oppone
yourselves to all that power that will or dare extoll itselfe not
only against God, but also against all sic as dare burden the conscience
of the faithfull farder then God hes burdened them be his
own word. But herein we may confesse our offence in that we have
entered farther in reasoning than we proposed and promised at the
beginning; and, therefore, we shortly returne to our former humble
supplication, whilk is, that our brethren, who amongst you refuse
the Romish raggs, may finde of you the Prelats sic favour as our
Head and Master commands every one of his members to show to
one another, whilk we look to receave of your gentleness, not only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
for that ye feare to offend God’s majestie in troubling your brethren
for sic vain trifles, but also because ye will not refuse the humble
request of us, your brethren and fellow-preachers, in whom, albeit
there appear not great worldly pomp; yet we suppose that ye
will not so farr despyse us, but that ye will esteem us to be of the
number of them that fight against that Roman Antichrist, and
travell that the Kingdome of Christ may be universally advanced.
The dayes are evill, iniquitie abounds, Christian charitie is waxin
cold, and, therefore, we ought more diligently to watch, for the hour
is uncertaine when the Lord Jesus shall appear, before whom ye,
your brethren, and we, must give ane account of our administratione.
And this, in conclusione, again we once crave favor to our
brethren, whilk granted, ye in the Lord shall command us in things
of double more importance. The Lord Jesus rule your hearts in
true feare unto the end, and give unto you and us victorie over
that conjured enemie of all true religione, to witt, over that Roman
Antichrist, whose wounded head Satin preases by all means to cure
again. But to destruction shall he and his maintainers goe, by the
power of our Lord Jesus; to whose mighty protectione we heartily
committ you. From Edinburgh, out of our Generall Assembly,

and donatione of benefices, as more ample in his signator is exprest.
If this be not to cure the head of that venemous beast whilk ance
within this realme, be the potent hand of God, was so banished
and broken downe that be tyranny it could not hurt the faithfull,
judge ye. His antient jurisdictione was, that he with certaine his
colleagues collateralls, might have damnit of heresie, upon probatione
as pleased him, and then to take all that were suspect of
heresie heretofore. Ye cannot be ignorant judges whether they
remaine in their former malice or not: their states and travells
openly declares. The danger may be feared, say ye; but what
remedie? It is easie and at hand, Right Honourable, if ye will
not betray the cause of God and leave your brethren, whilk never
will be more subject to that usurped tyrannie then they will unto
the Diuell himselfe. Our Queen belyke is not well informed. She
ought not, nor justly may not, breake the lawes of this realme; and
so consequently she may not raise up against us, without our consent,
that Roman Antichrist againe: ffor in ane lawfull and free
Parliament as ever was in the realme before, was that odious beast
depryved of all jurisdictione, office, and authority within this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
realme. Her Majestie, at her first arryvall, and be diverse her
proclamations sinsyne, hes expressly forbidden all uther forme and
fact of religione then that whilk she fand publickly established at
her arryvall: Therefore she may not bring us the greatest part of
the subjects of this realme back againe to bondage, till that alse
lawfull and alse free ane Parliament as justly damned that Antichrist
and his usurped authority have given decision betwixt us
and him heirof, and of uther things that no less concerns yourselfes
then us, ye plainly and boldly admonishe our Soveraigne, and without
tumult only crave justice. The tyrants dare no more be seen
in lawful judgement, nor dare the howlats in the day light. Weigh
this matter as it is, and ye shall finde it more weighty then to
many it appears. Farther, at this present we complain not, but
humbly craves of your honors ane reasonable answer, what ye will
doe in case that sic tyrants, devowering wolves be given to invade
the flock of Jesus Christ within this realme, under what title that
ever it be; ffor this we boldly confess, that we will never acknowledge
uther pastors to our saules, nor yet judges to our cause; and if
that for denyall thereof, we either suffer in body or goods, we doubt
not but we have not only ane Judge to punishe them that unjustly
trouble us, but also ane Advocat and strong Champion in heaven,
to recompense them who for his name sake suffer persecutione,
whose Holy Spirit so rule your hearts in his trew fear unto the end.
Your Lordships’ answer yet again we crave. Given in the Generall
Assembly, and third Session thereof, at Edinburgh, December 27,

<p>My Lord, (or Worshipfull Sir,) after our most hearty commendationes
of service in the Lord Jesus: Having now of lang tyme
travelled both in publick and private with all the estates, craving of
your honors in speciall, that the course of the evangell of salvation,
now ance of the liberall mercy of God restored to this realme, might
continue to all your comfort and your posterities; and that for the
maintainance and furtherance thereof, and perfyte policie and full
liberty, might be granted to this reformed kirk within Scotland; the
ministrie, the poor and failzied provided for sufficiently, as God, good
policy, and civill lawes, ordaines and requires, and that all superstition,
idolatrie, and the monuments thereof, might be utterly removed
and banished out of the realme, whilk God of his infinite
mercy hes so lovingly called from darkness to light. This matter,
indeed, was lyked of all men, but sic impediments gave the enemie
of the kirk, in his members, to stay the good work of God, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
moyen could there nane be had; but be contrare, at every light
occasione the ministrie frustrate of all life and sustenatione, the
lamed and impotent members of Christ lying in the strait of dying,
perishing for hunger and cold&mdash;yea, and the haill flock of Christ
Jesus within this realme continuallie threatened with the execution
of that most cruell decreet of the late Councill of Trent, wherin
was determined and decreeted to make ane sacrifice of the haill
professors within all Europe, be the tyrannie of that Romane Antichrist.
We are not ignorant how far the samen was attempted
be way of deed within the realme of France, how farr now in Flanders
and the parts near adjacent thereto, and also what practising to
that effect hes been continually thir three years bypast, and even
now, of late dayes within our own bowells, be our common conspired
enemies, alsweill within as without this realme; how they went to
their enterprize, if God had not of his meere mercy prevented, beyond
all our knowledge and expectation, their cruell and crafty practises:
Upon the whilk consideration, the Assembly, at this present
Conventione of the Kirk, accustomed at the course of tyme occurrand,
hes found it needfull and expedient to repare the decay and
ruine of the kirk so vertuouslie begune amongst us, be ane universall
concurrence and consent of the haill professors of Christ
Jesus within this realme, and be the same meanes to evite the foresaid
danger hingand over our heads, proceeding from the craft of our
implacable enemies, alswell within as without the same; and to that
effect hes ordained ane Generall Assembly of the haill professors of
all estates and degrees, within the Kirk of Scotland, to be holden
within the town of Edinburgh, upon the 20th day of the next
moneth of July, whereby ane perpetuall order may be taken for the
liberty of the Kirk of God, sustentation of the ministers, and failzied
members thereof, and that ane sure union and conjunctione may be

the rage of violence of our foresaid enemies: And because it
has pleased the goodness of God so to move your lordship’s heart,
that ye are become ane notable instrument and minister of his kirk,
as our hope is, so shall our prayer be, that ye may continue increasing
from vertue to vertue, unto life everlasting. We thought it
our duty, in name of our haill brethren here conveened, to notify to
your lordship the foresaid appointment of the said Assembly, and in

<p>Whether if it be lawfull to marry her whom he before in his

cryme of adultrie committed be him; Nottheless, Sir William
Hamiltone of Sanquhair, Knight, now ane Elder of the said kirk,
plainly maintaineth the said John in his house, notwithstanding the
said John is excommunicat, to the greate sclander and offence of
God his law: And albeit the said Sir William hes been diverse

<p>Certain brethren were appointed to conveen to sie and advyse
upon the Assignatione of the Stipends of the Ministrie lately assigned
be the Queen’s Majestie, the good payment, who fand in
effect as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>We have seen the assignationes within the shreffdomes of Kincardine,
Forfar, Perth, and Fyfe, and finds that all the haill contained
therein, at least for the most part, hes been thankfully payed,
and that the collector hes given his charges for payment thereof
duly, and rests nothing but to put them to the horne, that there be
letters direct, and commission given in the said letters, with consent
of the thesaurer, to collect and uptake the haill fruits of the benefices
of so many as past to the horne for the 1566 year, and sicklyke
for the 1567 year instant, so long as they remane, and to make
compt of the thrid to the ministrie, and so meikle of the two part as
they intromett with to the thesawrer as escheat; and as to the victuall
within the forsaids shyres, we finde that long before any letters
raised upon this assignation, and before the baptisme of the
prince, they were sold to the comptroller, and therefore he must be
charged in his compts to rander sa meike of the prices heirof againe
to the ministers, as is contained in his assignation. Touching
the thirds of the ministers’ assignation beyond Die, except Orkney,
findes be the collector that the 1566 yeares cropt is not used to be
payed whill Lambes in the 1567 year after; and for execution
given to him within bounds shall pass with the possible diligence, and
charge that haill bounds according to the letters, of the whilks he
supposes good payment, as hes been of before, except the bishoprick
of Caithness, whilk the collector alleadges the bishop payes to
his ministers of his own kirk, conforme to the book and compts
made of before. <em>Item</em>, Deare, Dunnett, and Pilorthe, are given free
to the Earle Marschell, and the friars of Aberdeen, to Captain Lauder;
but it is understood that all the gifts are revoked, and therefore
the collector is to charge them. <em>Item</em>, The victuall within the same
bounds are sold <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ut supra</i>, and therefore the comptroller in his compts
shall render conforme to the first article. <em>Item</em>, Besouth Forthe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
nothing gotten in; but the collector alleadges that Duncan Livingstoune
hes taken up 11 sh. of xxxvij lb. 11 sh. ijd., as he hes granted
be the particular receipt, and therefore he must be charged to delyver
the same to the said collector. <em>Item</em>, Of the thrids contained
within his collectorie, that it is alleadged discharged of the Abbay
of Cambuskenneth, to 323 lb. 6 sh. 8d. 3 chalders beir, and 3
chalders meall. The thrids of Drybrugh, 304 lb. and 62 part boll
qwhyte, 8 chalders, 2 bolls, two part boll beir, 7 chalders, 10 bolls,
two part boll meill.</p>

<p>The thirds of Melros, Haddingtoune, and Northberrwick, the
third of Kelso and Coldinghame; as to Dumfries, Annandale, and
Kirkcudbright, and Wigtoune, the Bishope of Gallaway hes deput
certain collectors for satisfactione of the ministers within the
samen.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, Within Kyle, Carrick, and Cunninghame, executiones past,
and believes to have payment at the nixt ganging in the countrie.
<em>Item</em>, Corsraguel is given frie, and the minister of Fairfurd is evill
payd that the act be reised, made be the Queen’s Grace and Secret
Councill, dischargeing the gifts and tacks of all the thirds, and that
nane be given hereafter, without advyse of the Secret Counsell, to
the effect the collector may charge, notwithstanding any sic gifts.
Remember that ilk collector execute within his bounds, that letters
be direct, with consent of the thesaurer, according to the first
article.</p>

to the articles following, at Edinburgh, Julii 20, <span class="nowrap">1567:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In the first: Forswameikle as there was ane Parliament holden

that the religione of Jesus Christ be universallie receaved
within this realme, should be universally established and approved
within the same, and all Papistrie, with the Papists usurped jurisdictione,
all Idolatrie, and especially the blasphemous Masse, be
abolished and put away; as the acts made thereupon proports:
Quhilk acts, together with the Queen’s Majestie’s power to hold
the same Parliament, the Noblemen, Barrons, and uthers undersubscrivand,
wills to be extract and putt in full executione as ane
publick law, and that the transgressors thereof be punished according<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
to the same throughout the haill realme, without exceptione:
Whilk Parliament in all things concerning the Religion, they shall
defend and maintaine at their uttermost, in the first Parliament
whilk shall be holden at all uther tymes and occasiones convenient:
<em>Item</em>, That the act allready made towards the thirds of the
benefices within this realme, principally for sustaining of the ministrie,
may be dewly put to executione, according to the order of
the Book of the appointment of ministers’ stipends, allsweel of them
that are to be appointed, as for them already placed; and that the ministers
be first duely answered and sufficiently sustained of the
same, to the relief of their present necessitie, ay and whill ane
perfect order may be taken and established toward the full distributione
of the patrimonie of the kirk, according to God’s word;
and that also the ordinance made be the Queen’s Majestie and her
Councill towards the small benefices, now extending to the soume
of three hundred merks, be dewly put to executione, alsweell toward
the benefices whilks hes vaiked since the date of the said ordinance,
as concerning them that shall happen hereafter to vake,
and sicklike the act made towards the anuales, abies and altarages
of burrowes.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, How soon ane lawful Parliament may be had, or that the
occasione may utherwayes justly serve, the nobles, barrones, and
uthers of the Kirk undersubscryvand, shall labour and prease at their
uttermost, that the faithfull Kirk of Jesus Christ profest within this
realme, shall be put in full liberty of the patrimony of the Kirk, according
to the Booke of God and the order and practise of the primitive
Kirk, and that nothing shall passe in Parliament unto the
tyme the matters of the Kirk forsaid be first considered, approved,
and established; and in the meantyme the professors undersubscryvand
consents and offers to reforme themselves according to the
Book of God, whilk they shall put in practise, and the refusers to
be secluded from the bosome of the Kirk.</p>

<p>And, moreover, in the said next Parliament, or utherwayes at the
first occasione, order shall be taken for ease of the poor labourers

and admitted be them to their charges.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, That all crymes and offences committed against God’s law
may be severally punished according to the word of God, and
where laws are presently appointed for the punishment, and judges
also deput to that effect, that the executione may be made thereupon
as effeirs: And where neither laws nor judges are appointed
for sic crymes as are to be punished be the law of God, that in the
first Parliament the same judges may be appointed, lawes established,
as God commands in his word.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, That since the horrible murther of the Queen’s Majestie’s
husband is so odious not only before God, but also to the haill
world, with continuall infamie and shame to this realme, if the
same murther shall not be punished accordingly: Therefore the
noblemen, barrones, and uthers undersubscryvand shall, with all
their forces, strength, and power, concurr and assist to take plaine
part together, to further and maintaine the punishment of the said
murther on all and whatsumever persones that shall be found
guiltie of the same; seeing the plague of God shall not depart from
the countrey or towne where innocent blood is shed, before the same
shall be cleansed be shedding of the blood of the offenders.</p>

<p>Seeing it hes pleased God of his mercy, to give ane native Prince
to this countrey, appearand to be our Sovereigne, to the end he be
not cruelly and shamefully murthered, as the King his father was,
the nobilitie, barrones, and uthers undersubscryvand, shall assist,

injurie.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, That all kings, princes, and magistrates, whilk hereafter in
any tyme to come shall happen to reigne and bear rule over this
realme, their first intres before they be crowned and inaugurat, shall
make their faithfull league and promise to the trew Kirk of God
that they shall maintaine and defend, and be all lawfull meanes sett
forward the trew religion of Jesus Christ, presently professed and
established within this realme, even as they are obliedged and actricted
in the law of God, alswell in Deuteronomie as in the second
chapter of the Book of the Kings, as they crave obedience of
their subjects; so the band and contract to be mutual and reciprocall
in all tymes comeing, betuixt the Prince and God, and also betuixt
the Prince and his faithfull people, according to the word of
God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p><em>Item</em>, That the Prince whom God hes given us, alsewell for his
surety as good educatione, shall be committed to wyse, ancient,
godly, and learned men of the realme, to be brought up within the
same, in the feare of God, and vertew, whereby he may so profite
in his youth, that when he shall come to his yeares of maturitie he
may be able to discharge himself sufficiently of that honor and
place where he shall be called, and prove that good king whilks, with
all their hearts, they wish him to be.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, The nobility, barrones, and utheris of the Kirk undersubscryvand,
in the presence of God, hes faithfully promised to conveene
themselves together with their power and forces, and here
begine to root out, destroy, and allutterly subvert, all monuments
of idolatrie, and mainely the odious and blasphemous Masse; and

forsaid, without exception of place or persones; and shall to
the uttermost of their power, remove all idolatrie and uthers that are
not admitted to the ministrie any manner of way, of the Kirk, from
all functione thereof, alswell private as publick, that they hinder
not the ministrie any manner of way in their vocatione; and in
place of the premises, sett up and establish the true religion of Jesus
Christ throughout this haill realme, be planting of Superintendants,
ministers, and uthers needfull members of the Kirk, seeing the host
of the Lord shall pass through the haill countrey to this effect; and
also shall proceed to the punishment of idolaters according to the
law thereupon pronounced: And sicklyke, shall punishe and cause
be punished, all uthers vices that presently abounds within this
realme, whilk God’s law and the civill law of this realme commands

and in lyke manner promises faithfully to reforme schooles,
colledges, and universities throughout the whole realme, and expell
and remove the idolaters that hes charges thereof and uthers who

<p>Anent the accusatione laid to my Lord Argyll’s charge, touching
the separation betwixt him and his wife; declared that he was
not the occasione thereof. As to other offences whatsoever,
wherthrough he hes been anywayes sclanderous to the Kirk, he
was content to subject himself to the discipline of the Kirk at all
tymes maist willinglie; and, therefore, the Kirk ordained the Superintendant
of Argyle to take tryall of the saids sclanders committed
be the said Earle, and thereafter to cause sic satisfaction
be made, as God’s Law appoints, and to report the order thereof to
the next Generall Assemblie of the Kirk, together with his own
diligence in executione of his office of Superintendancie.</p>

<p>Anent the marriage of the Queen with the Earle Bothwell, be
Adam, called Bishop of Orkney; the haill Kirk finds that he transgressed
the act of the Kirk in marrying the divorced adulterer;
and, therefore, deprives him of all functione of the ministrie, conforme
to the tenor of the act made thereupon, ay and whill the
Kirk be satisfied of the sclander committit be him.</p>

<p>The same day Mr John Craige was bruitit for proclaiming the
bands betwixt the Queen and the Earle Bothwell; who answered be
word, justifying his proceedings thereanent, and was ordained to
give in his purgation in write, to the effect his good mynd and proceedings
may be knowne to all and sundrie that hereafter would be
satisfied thereanent.</p>


<p class="p2 center fs80">TENOR OF THE FORESAID PURGATIONE.</p>

<p>To the end that all that feares God may understand my proceedings
in this matter, I shall shortly declare what I did, and what
moved me to defend the samen, leaving the finall judgement of all
things to the Kirk. First, be the request of Mr Thomas Hepburne,
in the Queen’s name, to proclame her with Lord Bothwell, I plainly
refused, because he had not her hand wreit; and also the common
bruit that my Lord had both ravished her and keeped her in captivitie.
Upon Wednesday last the Justice Clerk brought me ane writing
subscryved with her hand, bearing in effect that she was neither
ravished nor yet retained in captivitie, and, therefore, charged me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
to proclaime. My answer was, I durst proclaime no bands, and
chiefly such without consent and command of the Church. Upon
Thursday next, the Kirk, after long reasoning with the Justice
Clerk, and amongst the brethren, at length concluded that the
Queen’s mynde should be published to her subjects thrie nixt preaching
dayes: But, because the Generall Assembly had inhibited all
sic marriages, we protested we would neither solemnize, naither yet
approve that marriage, but would only declare the Prince’s mynde,
leaveing all doubts and dangers to the counsellors, approvers, and
allowers of that marriage: And so, upon Fryday thereafter, I declared
the haill minde and progress of the Kirk, desyreing every
man, in God’s name, to discharge his conscience before the Secret
Councill; and to give boldness to uthers, I desyred of the Lords
there present in tyme and place, to speak my judgement before the
parties, protesting, if I were not heard and satisfied, I either wald
desist from proclameing, or else declare my minde publickly before
the Kirk. Therefore, being admittit, afternoone, before my Lord in
Councill, I laid to his charge the law of adulterie, the ordinance of the
Kirk, the law of ravishing, the suspicion of collusioune betwixt him
and his wife, the sudden divorcement and proclaiming within the
space of four dayes, and last the suspicioune of the King’s death,
whilk his marriage will confirme. But he answered nothing to my
satisfactione: Wherefore, after many exhortationes, I protested
that I could not but declare my minde openly to the Kirk. Therefore,
upon Sonday, after I had declared what they had done, and
how they would proceed whether we would or not, I tooke Heaven
and earth to witness that I abhorred and detested that marriage,
because it was odious and sclanderous to the world; and seeing the
best part of the realme did approve it, either be flatterie or else be
their silence, I desyred the faithfull to pray earnestly that God
would turne it to the comfort of this realme, that thing whilk they
intended againes reasone and good conscience. I, because I heard
some persones gangand againes me, used thir reasones for my defences:
First, I had broken no law be proclaiming of thir persones
at their request: Secondly, If their marriage was sclanderous and
hurtfull, I did well for warning all men of it in tyme: Thirdly, As
I had of dewtie declareit to them the Prince’s will, so did I faithfully
tell them be word and example what God craveit of them. But
upon Tuesday last I was calleit before the Councill, and accuseit
that I had passed the bounds of my commissioune calling the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
Prince’s marriage odious and sclanderous before the world. I answered,
the bounds of my jurisdictione, whilk was the word of God,
guid lawes, and naturall reasone, was able to prove whatsoever I
spake; yea, that their owne conscience could not but beare witness
that sic a marriage would be odious and sclanderous to all that should
hear of it, give all the circumstances thereof were rightly considered:
But whill I was comeing to my probatione, my Lord put me to silence,
and sent me away; and so upon Wedensday I first repeatit and
ratified all things before spoken; and after, exhorted the brethren
not to accuse me give that marriage proceeded, but rather themselves,
who would not, for feare, oppone themselves, but rather
sharpeit their tongues against me, because I admonished them of
their deutie, and suffered not the kankert consciences of hypocrites
to sleep at rest; protesting at all tymes to them, that it was not my
proclaiming, but rather their silence, that give any lawfullness to
that marriage: ffor as the proclaiming did take all excuses from
them, so my private and publick impugnatione did safe my conscience
sufficiently; and this farr I proceeded in this marriage,
as the Kirk of Edinburgh, lords, earles, and barrones that heard me,
beare me witnes. Now, seeing I have been shamefully sclandered,
both in Scotland be wrang informatione, and als report of them that
hated my ministrie, I desyre first the judgement of the Kirk, and
next the same to be published, that all men may understand whether
I be worthie sick ane bruit or not.</p>

<p>Anent the complaint give in against my Lady Argyle, declaring
how sche once being at the table of the Lord Jesus, and professing
his Evangell, had revolted therefrae, in giving her assistance and
presence to the baptizing of the King in ane papisticall manner.
The said lady being present, grantit that she had offended to the
eternall God, and been ane sclander to the Kirk in committing the
premises; and therefore willingly submitted herself to the discipline
of the Kirk and discretioune of them. Therefore, the Kirk ordaines
the said lady to make publick repentance in the Chapell-Royall
of Stirling, upon ane Sonday in tyme of preaching; and this to
be done at sick tyme as the Kirk hereafter shall appoint to the Superintendant
of Lowthiane, provyding alwayes it be before the next
Assembly.</p>

<p class="p1 pfs80">OF DOCUMENTS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE
FIRST FIFTEEN GENERAL ASSEMBLIES.</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>The period of time referred to in this <em>First Part</em> of the Booke of the
Kirk, extending from the year 1560 to the end of 1567, embraces
the earliest era of its existence as a National Church, recognized
in the first instance, and ultimately established by the law of the
State; and it has been deemed expedient, in this special portion
of the present publication, to annex the various acts of
Privy Council and Parliament, applicable to that period, as an
Appendix to the actings of the first fifteen General Assemblies
of the Church, many of which bear reference to these
enactments of the civil authorities. These civil and ecclesiastical
proceedings throw mutual light on each other, and, conjoined,
they afford the most satisfactory view of its progress from the
time that it was first sanctioned, until it was finally settled and endowed
as the Established Church of Scotland. During the period
referred to, it can only be viewed as a tolerated Christian society,
but partially countenanced by the State, and struggling to
obtain a permanent place among the settled institutions of the
land. Thenceforward it is to be regarded as one of the integral
elements of the constitution, blended and united with the monarchy
and the supreme authority of the State in the Legislature.
And hence arises the propriety of thus conjoining the
civil and ecclesiastical proceedings during this, the first epoch of
its history as the Kirk of Scotland.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Generall Assembly of the Kirk convenit in Edinburgh, in
the Nether Tolbuith thereof, the first day of July 1568: In
the whilk was present the Nobilitie, Superintendants, Ministers,
and Commissioners of Towns and Kirks. Thanks was
gine to God, and supplicatioune maid for his assistance of
his Haly Spirit be Mr John Willock, &amp;c.</p>
</div>


<p>The same day for eschewing of confusione in reasoning, and that
every brother speak moderately in his owne rowme, and that with
reverence and licence, the haill brethren assembleit choose Mr
John Willock, Superintendant of the West, to be Moderator for
this present Assemblie, who, being chosen, acceptit the office under
protestatione that obedience be gine.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sess. 2<sup>a</sup>. Julij 6, 1568.</p>

<p>Anent the ordour hereafter to be usit in Generall Assemblies, to
the desyre of ane letter presentit be ane brother, for receaveing of
the ordour heirtofoir, they all votted and concluded as follows, viz.
That giue the ordour already receavit pleases not, men be reason
of pluralitie of voytes.</p>

<p>It was thought meit to reforme in this manner: First, That nane
have place to voite except Superintendants, Commissioners appointit
for visiting of kirks, Ministers brocht with them, presentit as persons
able to reasone, and having knowledge to judge with the foirnamit,
salbe joynt Commissioners of burghs and shyres, together
with Commissioners of Universities.</p>

<p>Secondlie, Ministers and Commissioners of shyres shall be chosen
at the Synodall Convention of the dioces, be consent of the rest of
the ministers and gentlemen that shall conveine at the said Synodall
Conventioune. Commissioners of burghs sall be appointit be the
(<span class="transnote nowrap">{blank space}</span>) Councill and Kirk of their owne townes.</p>

<p>Thirdlie, Nane to be admittit without sufficient commissione in
wreit, and on a venture: if this should come ane monopole and perpetuall
electione of a few certaine ministers and commissioners, it
is concluded that they be changit fra Assembly to Assembly.</p>

<p>Anent the questioune of murther upon suddentie, and for satisfaction
to be made to the kirk theirfore: First, it was answerit that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
the cryme being confessit, or convict lawfully, the offender shall be
admonischit be the Superintendant, or be the nixt reformit Kirk
where the slaughter was committit, to abstaine from all participatioune
of the Sacraments, untill that he shall satisfie the Kirk as sall
be appoyntit, and that their admonition sall be published where the
cryme was committit, and where the recent bruite thereof was
spread; to the end that men may understand that the Kirk winks
not at the shedding of innocent blood. Secondlie, if the cryme be
denyit, and that the bruit thereof be constant, and as it were publick,
yet shall the suspect be commandit to abstaine from the use of the
sacraments, untill sic tyme as farder tryall may be had, or else that
he be solemnlie purgit of the bruit, as for the sudden murther; and
that quhilk is committit purposlie we remitt the answer thereof to
ane former act.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Anent the forme of receaving of the homicid or adulterer to
the societie of the Kirk.</p>
</div>

<p>Nane that hes committit slaughter, adulterie, or incest, or hereafter
shall committ the same, shall be receavit to repentance be any
particular kirk, till that first they present themselffs before the
Generall Assemblie, thair to receave their injunctions; and thereafter
they shall keep the same order that was prescryved to Paull
Methven in his repentance; this being addeit, that he or they shall
beir in their hand at all the tymes of their publick repentance the
same or lyke weapon wherewith the murther was committit.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sessio 3<sup>tia</sup>. Julii 7, 1568.</p>

<p>It was declared and fund, that Thomas Bassendie, printer in Edinburgh,
printed ane book, intituled the Fall of the Roman Kirk,
nameing our King and Soveraigne supreame Head of the primitive
Kirk. Also, that he had printit ane Psalme Book, in the end
whereof was fund printed ane baudy song callit Wellcome Fortune;
whilk books he had printed without licence of the magistrat or revising
of the Kirk: Therefore, the haill Assembly ordained the said
Thomas, to call in againe all the forsaids books that he has sauld,
and keep the rest unsauld untill he alter the forsaid title, and also
that he delait the said baudy song out of the end of the Psalme
Book; and, farther, that he abstaine in all tyme comeing from further
printing any thing without licence of the supreame magistrate,
and reviseing of sic things as pertaine to religione be some of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
Kirk appointit for that purpose. Attour, the Assembly appointit
Mr Alexander Arbuthnot to revise the rest of the forsaid tractat, and
report to the Kirk what doctrine he finds therein.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sess. 4<sup>a</sup>. July 8, 1568.</p>

<p>Anent the excommunication of Papists, and separation of them
from the societie of Christ’s bodie, after dew admonitione, refuising
to joyne themselffes to the Kirk: It is concludeit, that, after they
have receavit sufficient admonitions, according to the order established
in particular kirks, and, they yet remaining obstinate, they
shall be declareit publickly in all congregations necessar, to be out of
the societie of Christ’s bodie, to be excommunicat.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><span class="smcap">Articles</span> presentit to my Lord Regent.</p>

<p>First, That his Grace knaw the heavie and grievous complaints
of ministers against them, to subscryve the assignatiounes through
the quhilk they are altogidder disappointed of their stipends, for
the assignationes standing, the thirds are not able, as they are ordered,
to pay the ministers’ half-year stipends; in some parts, not
the quarter thereof.</p>

<p>It is thought ane thing very unreasonable that the Papists, enemies
of God’s Kirk and the commonewealth, and utheris that
labours not in the ministrie, shall possess freely, without impositione,
the third of the benefice, and the Kirk, whilk labours, shall not possess
the third.</p>

<p>Herefore, the Kirk desyres that my Lord Regent’s Grace will
take sic order that the commone charges might be sustained upon
the two parts of the benefice possessed be the Papists, and that the
third may remaine frie to be disponit to the Kirk; not that the
ministers desyres more nor thair reasonable stipends, but that the
superplus might support schools and the poor, according to the will
of God; and that the collectors of the Kirk shall yearly make
compt thereof, so that my Lord Regent’s Grace and the Councill
shall know the dispositioune of the samen.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, To schaw to my Lord Regent’s Grace, that there is sundrie
benefices vaikand, and specially the benefices of the commones
pertaining to Cathedrall and Metropolitane Kirks, that his Grace
would put them to qualified men, be the advyce of the Kirk, at this
tyme, the Kirk being assembled; utherwayes the Kirk must dispone
them as falling to them be reasone of sax moneths past, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>

to put qualified persones to them, as in speciall to Northberrick.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, That my Lord Regent’s Grace will give commissione and
authoritie to certaine persones for reformatione of the Colledge of
Aberdeene, that the corrupt office beirers, Regents and uthers be
removit, and uther qualified persones placeit in their rowmes, so
that the zouth may be instructed in godliness and guid literature.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, To desyre my Lord Regent’s Grace, order to be taken for
suppressing of vice; whereby the plague of God may be withdrawne
from the countrie, and that his Grace will take diligent
care anent the execution of justice againes sic odious crymes as
shall be giue his Grace in wreit, be the Superintendants and Commissioners
of Countreyes.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, That his Grace would cause sic as are appointed of the
Councill, conveen with them that are appointed of the Kirk, touching
the jurisdiction of the same to decyde therein, that tyme and
place may be condescended upon to that effect; and that it be done
before the Parliament.</p>

that in the rowmes and countreyes where no superintendants are,
they may be placed.</p>

<p>Brethren, We thocht it expedient to certifie yow that being in
France, and hearing the great troubles in this our native countrey,
of conscience and dewtie was compellit to come home, desyreous to
helpe to pacifie the same at our utter power: First to the glory of
God Almightie, and next to the relief of the right sair and lamentable
oppressed trew subjects, quhais innocent blood and innumerable
heirschips, oppressiones, wrongs and slewths that hes been committit,
and daily is upon them, is to us so grievous and intollerable
a burden both in conscience and honor, that we refuse not only this
our native realme, but also the hale warld or it were not reformit;
and albeit in my absence I have sustained wrong, I assure my owne
particular naither in blood, lands, nor gear, is so heavie to me as
the great danger this haill kingdome stands intill, giue be the grace
of Almighty God, and help of the old and natiue Scotts blood, it
be not foreseen and relieved in tyme. Heiring of your Conventione,
brethren, at this tyme, I have send this bearer to you to declare
this to be our full and determinit minde to follow be the grace
of God; First, That the word of God may have free passage through
this haill realme, and that the sacraments may be ministrat according
to the institutione of Christ Jesus his Sone our Saviour: Next,
That every true subject of this realme may live without feare upon
that whilk is justly his owne, according to God’s calling and commandement.
In this cause of this present diversitie of our native
Soveraigne and ane pairt of her subjects, ffor the qwhilk we are
very heartilie sorrie, and as Almightie God knawes innocent of
foirknawledge of any thing, so we would wische all uthers to be the
lyke. Our desyre is, that all hostilitie and troubles might be pacified
according to the command of God, and that the haill Estates
in quiet and peaceable manner may continew, and first calling for
his grace and Holy Spirite of righteous judgement, might consider
the ground and beginning of this altogidder evill deid, I meane the
slaughter of the Queen’s late husband, what hes proceedet thereupon
sinsyne, and what God wald of reasone sould be done therefore;
and this to be devysed either be the haill estates or 25 of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
wysist of the nobilitie chosen be the haill, and to be followit be the
whole people of the realme, whereunto we of the nobilitie and all
that continews under our obedience to the Queen our Soveraigne,
sall for God’s and for the commone weall be found agreeable. I
avoyde the wrougous judgement may be spoken that we wreit this
to yow because of proclamations that the Earle of Murray hes made
in diverse shyres of this realme, to have the people in Glasgow the
10. of March: We would ye should consider we doe it not for that
cause: ffor first as ye knaw sen before thir troubles begane we have
never been in this countrie before the 25. of this instant Februarii,
wherethrough we might haue shawen our minde herein, and all the
people of Scotland war gathered together, both for nativeness of
blood and for good deserving of my forbears and my selffe, thairs the
strenth of the world quhilk I could wishe myself and find me maist
sure; and giue the said Earle of Morray wold take upon him to
invade me or any of my friends or dependars, or any trew man of
this realme, (as I cannot think he will,) then trust I, that the nobilitie
or people will not assist him thereto, whill first they finde ane
cause worthy, and be declared be the antient lawes of the realme:
And though we desyre thir conventions and forces of men of war to
be turnit upon the thiefes and oppressors of the realme; whereunto
we shall be most ready with our bodies and gear to doe the
devoure of noble and trew men; yet, giue he will persevere to persew
us, we doubt not in God and the justice of our cause, to finde
all the noble and trew men so favourable to us, that it shall not be
in his power to doe us wrong upon particular malice, altogether
without deserving. Therefore, we require you in God’s behalfe to
make some of our affaires and mynde patent unto the people, and
giue ye finde not on our pairt socht here, and offerit that our
Christiane professione dewlie requireth, that ye come and reasone
the same with us, where ye shall finde us reasonable in all causes
according to God’s word and equitie, on qwhaies divyne protectione
we committ you. Off Hamiltoune, the 27th of February.</p>

<p class="p1 center">Sess. 5<sup>a</sup>. July 9, 1569.</p>

<p class="center">My Lord Regent’s Letter to the Assembly.</p>

<p>After our maist hearty commendations; Seeing we are not able to
be present at the Assembly now approachand, as our intentione was,
We thocht it convenient, brieflie to give you significatioune of our
meaning in wreit, of the quhilk we pray you to take good consideration,
and, accordingly, to give your advertisement. Ye are not ignorant,
as we suppose, what has beene the estate of the Kirk of God
within this realme, baith before we acceptit the burding of regiment
and sinsyne: How, first, the thirds of benefices war grantit to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
the ministrie, thereby partlie relievit and sustainit in sic sort, that
nothing inlaikit that our travells could procure. The first order,
indeed, was divers wayes interruptit and brokin in, but chiefly in
that year when we were exyled in England, quhairthough that year
the haill ministers war frustrate of their livings. Shortly, in the
estate of Government altering at God’s pleasure, and the King our
soveraigne being inaugurat with the crowne of this kingdome, the
first thing we war careful of was, that the trew religion might be
established, and the ministers of the Evangell made certain of their
livings and sustentatione in tyme comeing: ye knaw, at the parliament
we war maist willing that the Kirk sauld haue been put in full
possessione of the proper patrimonie, and toward the thrids we expeded
in our travel, and inlaikit only a consent to the dissolutione
of the prelacies, whereunto, although we were earnestly bent, yet the
estates delayit and wold not agree thereunto; and sen that tyme to
this houre, We trust we will affirme, that we have pretermittit
nothing that may advance the religione, and put the professors
thereof in surtie, whereanent the haill and only inlaike hes been in
the ciuill troubles that God hes suffered the countrie to be plagued
with. Now, the matter being, after so great rage, brought to some
stay and quietness, it was convenient that we returne where matters
left and prease to reduce them to the estate they stand in. Ane
thing we must call to remembrance, that at sic tyme as we travellit
in the parliament to cause the estates to agrie, that the thrids
should be decernit to pertaine to the ministrie, they plainly opponit
them to us in respect of the first act, alleadgeand, that, with the
sustentation of the ministrie, there was also regard to be had to the
support of the puire, in sustaining of the public chairges, quhilks,
if they had not some reliefe be that meine, the revenue of the
crowne being so diminisched, and the ordinare charges cume to sic
grytnes, on force they wold be burdenit with exactions; and so this
dangerous argument compellit us to permitt to the estates, that we
wold take upon us, the act being grantit to the Kirk, they should
satisfie and agrie to ony thing sould be thocht reasonable, for
supporting of the public charges of the prince. And, according
to this, the Commissioner Deput for the affaires of the
Kirk agriet to certaine assignations of the thrids for supporting
of the King and us bearing authoritie; quhilk order had
been sufficient for the haill, give the ciuil trouble had not occurrit;
yet the disobedience growand so universallie, we are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
content to sustaine ane part of the inlaik and loss for the tyme past.
But because there hes bene murmure and grudge for that thing assignit
to the King’s houss and ours, and some other needfull things
in the State, as that thereby the Ministers were frustrate of their
appointit stipends, some communicatione was had at St Androis,
and nothing yet concludit qwhill the Generall Assembly of the
Kirk, quhilk now moves us wreit to yow in this forme, prayand
yow richtlie to consider the necessitie of the cause, and how the
same hes proceeded frae the beginning, haveing respect, that the
Kirk will not be very well obeyit without the King’s authoritie and
power, and that now the propertie of the Crowne is not able to sustaine
the ordinarie chairges. How in the beginning the thrids had
not been grantit giue the necessitie of the prince had not been ane
of the chief causes; and at the parliament, the estates, as we have
before written, stak to consent that the haill thrids sould be declareit
to pertaine to the ministrie, whill first we take in hand, that they
being made without conditione in favours of the Kirk, the same
wold againe condescend to so meikle as wold be sufficient to the
support of the publick affaires, in furthsetting of the King’s authoritie,
and that therefore we will agrie and condescend to ane certaine
and speciall assignatione of it, that sall be imployit to this use:
The quantity qwhairof, diverse of your selves and the beirer heirof,
Mr John Wood, our servant, can informe you, that after ye may
distribute to everie ane haveing chairge in the Kirk of God his
stipend, according to the conditione of the place he serves in, according
to your wisdomes discretione. Hereby, all confusione that
lang hes troublit the estate of the Kirk toward the stipend, shall be
avoidit, and some speciall provision being made for sustaining of
their publick chairges, we may the better hald hand to sie the Kirk
obeyit of that whereon the ministers should live, as ye shall reporte.
That dureing our travells in the north countrey, they have
found our effectious good will, and travellit in their furtherance.
Farder, we man put yow in minde brieflie of ane matter that occurrit
at our late being in Elgine. Ane Nicoll Sudderland in
Forres was put to the knawledge of ane assyse for incest, and with
him the woman: the assyse hes convict him of the fault; but the
question is, whether the same be incest or not, so that we behovit to
delay the executione whill we might have your resolutione at this
Assemblie. The case is, that the woman was harlot of before to the
said Nicoll’s mother brother. Herein Mr Robert Pont can informe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
yow mair amplie, to whais sufficiencie we remitt the rest. Mair
over, at our coming at Aberdeen, there came ane named Porterfield,
minister, provydit of before to the Viccarage of Ardrossane,
and required also of us, that he might also have the viccarage of
Steinsone, seeing both was ane matter meine aneuch to sustaine
him, and because the kirks war neir, he might discharge the

qwhilk was found good, and all the brethren serving the functione

tennor followes in thir words:</p>

<p>Forsuameikle as ane comely and decent apparell is requisite in
all, namely in the ministers, and sic as bearis function in the Kirk;
First, we think all kinds of broidering unseemly, all bagaries of
velvet on gowns, hoses, or coats, and all superfluous and vain cutting
out, steiking with silks, all kinde of coastlie sewing on pasements,
or sumptuous and large steiking with silks; all kinde of
costly sewing or variant heuis in sarks, and kinde of licht and variant
hewis in cloathing, as red, blew, ʒellow, and sicklyke, qwhilk
declares the lightnesse of the mynde; all wearing of rings, bracelets,
buttons of silver, gold, or other mettal; all kinde of superfluitie of
cloath in making of hose; all useing of plaids in the kirk be readers
or ministers, namely in tyme of their ministrie, and useing their
office; all kinde of gowning, coating, doubletting, or breitches of
velvet, satine, taffetie, or suchlyke; all costly guilting of whingers
or knifes, and sicklyke; all silken hatts, and hatts of diverse and
light colloures: But that their haill habite shall be of grave collour,
as black, russet, sad gray, sad browne, or serges, wirsett, camlet,
growgrame, lytes, worsett, or sicklyke; and to be short, that the
good word of God be them and their immoderateness be not sclanderit;
and their wifes to be subject to the same order.</p>

<p>It appeared to some of the brethren that the lang continuance of
Commissioners in their office, should induce some ambitione and
inconvenience within the Kirk, and therefore was thocht a matter
to be consultit in this Assemblie, Whether it was best that Commissioners
of provinces should be changit from year to year from
the countries where they travell to uthers? After lang reasoning,
the greatest part of the Assemblie thocht best, where men may be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
had able to use the Commissione, that ane yearly exchange should
be.</p>

<p>Ordaines Mr James Lawsone, James, Bischope of Glasgow, Mr
Andrew Hay, Mr George Hay, with Alexander Hay, Clerk of
Privie Councill, to concive ane article in wreit, concerning the

of the Bischopes as they are now in this realme, and of their
Chapters, appoyntit for creating of them, be tollerable, and to return
their judgment to the Assemblie, gave in their opinione as
after follows in wreit, viz., They think it not expedient presently to
answer directly to the first questione; but, if any Bischope beis
chosen who hes not fit qualities as the Word of God requires, let
him be tryed be the Generall Assembly <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de novo</i>, and so deposit.</p>

<p>The poynts wherein they agree concernyng the office of ane Bischope,
or ane Superintendant: First, the name of Bischope is injurie to
all them that hes a particular flock over the quhilk he hes ane peculiar
charge alsewell to preach the word as to minister the sacraments,
and to execute the ecclesiasticall discipline with consent of
his elders, and this is his chiefe functione of the Word of God. Attour
out of this number may be chosen some to his power, to oversie
and visite sic reasonable bounds besyde his awne flock as the
Generall Kirk shall appoint; and in these bounds to appoint ministers,
with consent of the ministers of that province, and consent of
the flock, to whom they shall be appoyntit; also to appoynt Elders
and Deacons in every principall congregatione where there is nane,
with consent of the people thereof, and to suspend ministers for
reasonable causes, with the consent of the ministers foresaids.</p>

<p>Qwhat punischment deserves that minister that marries persones
refuised be their ordinare minister, and that in respect they keepit
open houses together uncontractit, and wald obey nae discipline,
and, qwheir their ordinare minister desyreit them to obey the discipline,
they woundit him to the death; upon the morne the said minister
married them, who without satisfactione made to the Kirk for
wounding their minister? Referrs the punishment of this minister
to the punishment againes Mr Patrick Craig.</p>

<p>Parties to be married sould cume before the Assemblie, and give
in their names, that their bands may be proclaimit, and no farther
ceremonies usit.</p>

<p>The Kirk hes power to cognosce and discerne upon heresies,
blasphematione of God’s name, witchcraft, and violatione of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
Lord’s day, not prejudgeand the punishment of the civill magistrate.</p>

<p>There is no law establischit, that, after a young man hes lyen
with ane young woman that is esteemit a virgine, na marriage proceidand,
nor promise alleadgit to hir, may be compellit be any
particular kirk, at the suit either of the woman or of the parents,
aither to marry her or pay her tocher gude.</p>

<p>Bairnes gotten before marriage, the lawfull marriage following,
are lawfull.</p>

<p>Qwhat punishment shall be for that minister that baptises ane
murtherer’s bairne not of his owne paroche, on an Munday, not
being ane day of preaching, and without repentance of the murtherer,
remainand at the King’s Grace’s horne? Answer, he [de]serves
deposition.</p>

<p>Gine it be lawfull for any minister to dispense with the number
of dayes appoyntit for the repentance of adulterous and incestuous
persones, in respect that the lyke obedience cannot be obtained in
all places? No answer.</p>

<p class="p1 center">Sessio 1.</p>

<p>Because the said Mr Alexander, Moderator, was absent from the
last Assemblie, in that respect not foirseen of the things done
therein, at his desyre, the Kirk appoyntit the Laird of Dun, Mrs
James Lawsone, Robert Pont, David Lyndsay, Andrew Hay, John
Craig, Andrew Melvill, to conveine the morne with him at sevine
houres in the morneing, and advyse upon sic matters as sall be
thocht good to be handlit in this Assemblie. The principall argument
to be intreatit in this Assemblie is this, The Policie of the
Kirk. The brethren deput to the conceiving and forming of the
heids thereof, being callit to give ane account of their diligence,
presentit the same as they had made partitione thereof at their Assemblie
at Streviling.</p>

<p>The heids pennit be Mrs James Lawsone and John Row were
read, and nothing again said, except ane of the said Mr Johnes articles

<p>The Laird of Dunn thocht the heid gine to him obscure. The
Kirk desyrit him to conferr with the remanent Commissioners the
morne at seven houres, that he may be resolvit of the meining
thereof. The remnant heids beand prolixt, were thocht good to be
contracted in short propositiones to be presentit to publick reiding.</p>

Lindsay: nothing alleadgit in the contrare.</p>

<p>The heids remittit to Mr Johne Craige: some things were desyrit
to be contractit, and uthers referrit to farther reasoning.</p>

<p>The haill labours of the brethren tane upon the matter and argument

this matter, being now dispersit, sould be revysit and pervysit be
some brethren, digestit and disposit in convenient order, to be
thereafter presentit to the Assemblie; and for that effect, the Kirk

the justice and equitie of God to take judgement and vengeance on
this unworthie nation; Seeing also the many and perilous strifes
and raiges of persecutione daily invading the Kirk and Spouse of
Jesus Christ, the sound and extreame troubles of the trew and zealous
members thereof in the parts of France and elsewhere, professing
with them ane Saviour, Lord, and Messias, the wark also of
establishing a perfyte order and policie in the Kirk being presently

joynit with the civill and domestick seditiones, qwhairunto doubtless
greater judgements must succeed gif his correctiones work no
reformatione nor amendment in men’s hearts: Seeing also the
bloodie conclusiones of the cruell councill of that Roman beast,
tending to exterminat and raze from the face of all Europe, the
light of the blessed word of salvatione: ffor these causes, and that
God of his mercy wald bless the King’s heines and regiment, and

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<p>I understand, the name, office, and modest reverence borne to a
Bischope to be lawfull and allowable be the Scriptures of God;
and, beand electit be the Kirk and King to be Bischop of Glasgow,
I esteem my calling and office to be lawfull: And, as anent my
executione of that charge committit to me, I am content to indeavour
at my outermost abilitie to performe the same and every
poynt thereof, and to abyde the honourable judgements of the Kirk
from tyme to tyme, of my offending by my dewtie; craving alwayes
a brotherly desyre at their hands, seeing the charge is weichtie;
and in the laying to be lait to my charge to be examined be the
cannone left be the apostle to Timothie, 1 and 1 cap., seeing that
place was appointit to me at my receipt.</p>

<p>To understand therefrom the dewties of a Bischope: As toward
my living, and rents, and uthers things grantit be the Prince to me,
I reckon the same lawfull: As to my dewtie to the supreame magistrat;
in assisting his Grace in Councill or parliament, being
cravit thereto, I esteem my subjection compels me to obey the
same, and no hurt but an well to the Kirk that some of our number
be at the making of good laws and ordinances; in the doeing
whereof I protest before God never to doe any thing but that I believe
shall stand with the puritie of the Scripture and a weill reformit

Duncansone, that they may both be mutuall, await upon his Grace
and the haill ministrie of his house.</p>

nominat be his Majestie to proceed in the farther conferrence of
the said policie, and tyme and place to be appoyntit for that effect.</p>

of the acts of the Generall Assemblie, as also summonds ministers
to take tryall of excommunicatione pronouncit be them

<p>The Generall Assembly hes concludit that all Readers within this

of the countries, with the advyce of their assessors, so far as possiblie
they may, betwixt and the nixt Generall Assemblie; and so
many as beis sound and travellit in reading be the space of twa

preache the word of God, shall be deposit from the reading be the
saids Commissioners, with assistance of their saids assessors, and the

declares that no simple Reader sall be capable of any benefice, or

<p>The Assembly hes recommendit the executione of the King’s

they will answer unto his heines and unto the Kirk.</p>

<p>It is thocht meit to be cravit of his heines, that the Kirk of God
within this realme may be restorit to the benefice, of the act of
parliament made concerning the thirds, in respect of the many and
grievous hurts qwhereby the Kirk recognises to have receavit be
the takeing away of the said act from them; Therefore it is thought
expedient the Moderator, with sic as are assessors to him upon the

to be presentit againe to the Kirk, and considerit be commone
advyce and consent of the Kirk.</p>

trew religione of God, qwherin he is content aither now or when
the King’s Majestie’s house beis settled, with his heart to subscryve
at the will of the Kirk as they sall think best.</p>

<p>It is, be vote of the haill Assembly, after lang disputatione, resolvit
and concludit, that it is not lawfull be the word of God, that
ane pastor be burdenit with the charge of feeding of twa particular
flocks or mare congregationes nor ane, nor yet bear the name or be
callit pastor of moe kirks nor ane.</p>

<p>The Generall Assemblie of the Kirk hes statute, that the Commissioners
of Countries shall call persones who hes, after their
professione of religion within the country, declynit to idolatrie,
and now returnit within the countrie, ilk ane within their awne

if they be tryit to have committit the said defectione, to charge
them to make repentance thereof, under the paine of excommunicatione;
and gif they disobey, to be excommunicat be sic persones
to be appoyntit be the Synodall Assemblie to that effect, lawfull
admonitiones preceiding; and if they offer obedience and repentance,
to superceid the taking thereof, the forme of the same be advysed

said Assembly; and heirin to report their diligence thairto, as they
will answer to God&mdash;and the same order to be observit with them
that willinglie acknowledges the said defectione, and comes and
offers their repentance.</p>

<p>Compeirit Captaine Anstruther, and lamentit to the Kirk, that
he beand in France, and certaine years bypast had gine his bodilie
presence to the Masse, albeit in conscience he hated the same as
idolatrie, and keepit alwayes upricht mynde towards the religione
profest in this realme, and feeling grief in his conscience for his
defectione, is come to utter his repentance unfainedly for the same,
submitting him to whatsumever correctione the Kirk will injoyne
him, desyrand to be reconcillit thereto; and, in token of his sincere
meining, held up his hand as to the boutcherie and massacre
of Paris, declares he keepit the King’s ʒett of Lovar, the tyme

<p>Forsuameikle as throw a great part of this countrie, the afternoone

<p>Qwhither if ane minister entering in the functione of a ministrie,
serving there in divers years by past, and thereafter leaves his vocatioun,
and applys him to a civill office, may be admitted to be ane
elder of the kirk? It is answerit, that this man is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">desertor gregis</i>,
and sould not be admittit to be ane elder, but rather aught to be
callit for his desertione.</p>

answer to their articles sent from the Assembly halden in Dundie,
3d July last, We causit sum of our counsell conferr with them severall
tymes in October last, as also now of late, qwhilks all finds
the matter towards the thirds of benefices mentionat in the first of
the saids articles, as the same is there requyrit, not to be the readiest
meine, either to make the ministers assured of their stipends and
livings, or yet to make us to have any reasonable support thereby,
for reliefe of the commone chairges of our estate, there being
so great alteratione and diminutione of the rents, and so great confusione
utherwayes enterit in that matter, dureing thir 20 yeares
and mair now bypast; and that thereby their behoves ane forme and
order be prescryvit unto, mair licklie to have continuance to the
posteritie to come: To the removeing of all occasions of complaint
for the furtherance thereof, there is be commandment and advyce
of sic of our councill and the ministrie as conferrit in this purpose,
some forme drawne, how Elderschips may be constitute of a certaine
number of parochines, lyand together; small parochines to be
united, and the greit dividit, for the better sustentation of the ministrie,
and the more commodious resort of the common people to
their kirks. There is also the forme of letter of ours to be written
to some of the principall noble and gentle men, and certaine of the
ministers within the bounds of every Elderschip, to conveine, advyse,
and reporte unto us their advyce in all things requyred be us
in our said Letter, betwixt and the 24 of Junii nixt. This we thocht
convenient to communicat with yow to the Assemblie now to be
convenit at Glasgow, requyring them in our name to consider
thereof, and to send to us their judgement and opinione anent this
intendit wark, and of any thing they wald wische aither to be added
or dimminished in the forme of our Letter utherwayes, before the
same shall be directed: qwhairanent, if care and diligence shall be
taken be them, as our intention, God willing, is to doe, to the forderance
thereof, as becomes ws, We have no doubt, but God
shall send fruitfull success of our travells, to the removeing of the
greit disorders and confusions now standing for want of reformatione.</p>

<p>These grounds advysit weill and agreit upon appearandlie, it
shall not only really, with reasonable tyme, make the ministers to be
surelie provydit of their livings, but it shall bring the ecclesiasticall
discipline to be farre better exercisit and execute over all this realme
nor it is presentlie; it beand declarit first, what every Presbyterie<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>

and last, what causes shall be devolvit to the Generall
Assemblie, and what persones shall orderlie neid to repair thereto,
and to have vote therein. The reporte of thir our Letters returning
againe the sooner, it may be provydit with diligent travells, in

November nixt without delay, and if our Parliament upon any necessar
occasione shall be conveinit. In the meane tyme, the said
ordour, or sa meikle thereof as shall be in readiness, may be past
and approvit in forme of law.</p>

<p>The second article was answerit in sic sort as we trust they were
satisfied therewith.</p>

<p>To answer the third article, the desire thereof must be more
speciall before it receave ane speciall answer: they have to consider
in qwhais default and negligence the persons complaint upon in
their forsaid article, remaynes unpunisched. Our answer to the
first article is sufficient, qwhill upon farder advyse it may be made
more speciall.</p>

<p>We doubt not also but our answer to the saxt article shall be
found reasonable upon speciall conferrence had thereanent, and that
their desyre, if it were grantit in the forme requyrit, could not but
induce inconvenients.</p>

<p>There is order taken anent the desyre of the sevent article.</p>

<p>There is same order alreadie begune for the farther help of the
Earle of Arrane, qwhilk shall be followit as occasione shall serve.</p>

<p>We have causit and yet will cause, the conferrence to be keepit,
for furthsetting of all things requisite, that may set fordwart the
Policie qwhill the same may be establischit be law.</p>

<p>Our former answers are reasonable, and no insisting has been in

not put in sic forme and termes as war meit to put them in Articles

therefore let the Assemblie appoynt some of their number to extend

<p>And that they give their advyce how the remanent kirks, whereunto

upon the clauses irritant conteinit in their provisiones, for not doing
their dewties in their vocationes, but leaving their charges and

the King’s Commissioners: qwhilk the Kirk altogether thocht meit,
and allowit the judgement of their brether.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sessio 7.</p>

<p>Compeirit James Melvill, Gentleman of the King’s Chalmer, and
presentit unto the Kirk, his Majesties writting concerning tryall to
be taken of certaine words alleadged spoken be Mr Walter Balcanquell
in his late sermone against his Heines cousine, Duke of Lennox,
with credit to the bearer, who schew that in this far he had
credit to speak, that because at the last calling of John Durie and
the said Mr Robert before the Privie Counsell, upon accompt of their
sermones, offence was taken in the Kirk, therefore his Grace laments
the matter to the Assemblie, willing them to try the matter and to
putt order therein.</p>

<p>The words wherein the Duke’s Grace is offendit are thir; That
the said Mr Walter had spoken in pulpit, that within this four
years, Papistrie had enterit in the countrie, not only in the court but
in the King’s hall, and maintained be the tyrannie of a great campione,
who is callit Grace; and if his Grace vald oppone himself to
God’s word, he sould haue little grace. Further, concernyng the
Bischope of Glasgow, the King’s Majestie desyrit they sould stay
any proceedings against him as bischop; yet if there be any uther
thing the Kirk hes to lay to his charge, let them use their order.</p>

<p>Hereunto the said Mr Walter answerit, Seeing in the King’s
Majesties letter and credite gine to the bearer thereof, he is accusit,&mdash;praying
the Moderator to suffer him to give his answer thereto;
the sum quhairof schortly shall be this: First, he praisit God that
he is not accusit of any thing wherein ather civilie or criminallie in
his life or conversatione, he hes offendit the King’s Majestie, or his
laws, whereunto with all reverence and all tymes he is readie to
submitt himself as effeirs, but is accusit of these things whilk he hes
spoken publickly in the pulpit, qwherein he hes been mair plaine in
reproveing of vice then sum men can goodlie suffer, qwhilk is a very
point of his doctrine; qwhilk, howbeit, he heir there callit open
sclander, yet he man so justifie the same, that although all the kings of
the earth wald call it erroneous, yet he is ready here be good reasone
to prove it to be the very trewth of God; and if neid sall requyre,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
to seall it with his blood. Secondlie, he praises God for this, that
of his last accusation, God hes giuen this meikle victorie to this
Kirk, that howbeit then it was callit in questione, to whom the judgement
of the doctrine sould appertayne, yet as then be good reasone
it was concludit and promised be the King’s Majestie, Counsell, and
Commissioners appoyntit therfra, to conferr with the ministers in
that matter, That in all tymes cuming the tryall of the ministers’
doctrine sould be referrit to the judgement of the Assemblie of the
Kirk, as the only competent judge thereto; so now it is performit,
and for that he sies that promise now keepit, he thanks God, and is
so meikle the more glad to give his answer before their godlie wisdomes
of the Assemblie present, as his competent judges in this
matter, and that after this manner. As concernyng these things
qwhilks he spake in his sermon the last Wedensday, he spake them
not quyetlie, but all his breither and all the haill Assemblie heard
them, and so, of all wthers, can best judge of the same. Wherefore,
with all reverence, he will submitt himself simply unto their godly
judgements, alwayes neither being aschamitt of his doctrine, neither
yet being myndit to giue advantage to his enemies, so far as he
may, whose purpose he knaws against him in this matter. He will
only requyre this conditione,&mdash;that the canone of the Apostle Paul
be keepit to him, qwhilk is this: Against ane elder receiue no accusatione,
but under two or three witnesses; according to the qwhilk
forme of proceeding, he craues in this matter here.</p>

<p>Are ye, the Assemblie of the Kirk, as competent judges unto
him? Here is he ready before your Wisdomes to answer to all accusationes
that sall be layd against him, and underly your judgments
therunto. Let any man, therefore, according to the canone of the
Apostle, qwhilk on no wayes ye can break, stand up here before
yow, and say he hes any thing to accuse the said Walter off, either
in lyfe or doctrine, and hes two or thrie witnesses readie with him to
prove his accusatione: then the said Walter shall answer him as
effeirs; for seeing James Melville heard not his doctrine, and therefore
will not take upon him to accuse the said Mr Walter, he will
superseid farther answer, qwhill he sie his accuser qwhatsumever,
to qwhom be the grace of God he sall be ready to answer as accords.</p>

<p>The Assemblie ordayns Mrs Thomas Smetone and Dauid Fargysone
to passe to the King’s Grace with this answer;&mdash;That seeing
Mr Walter is ane brother in the ministrie, the canon of the Apostle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
must be keepit unto him; and therefore the accuser, with his two
witnesses, ocht to be had. Farther, that in respect of the last calling
of John Durie before the Privy Counsell, upon ane compt of

the knawledge may be had if they haue inbrocht any papists, under
the paine of excommunicatione and censures of the Kirk to be execute
against them; and this Act to be publickly intimat to the
ministers of the saids townes and ports,&mdash;to the effect that no ignorance
be pretendit heirof; and suchlyke, supplicatione to be made
to the magistrates of the saids townes and ports, that they will giue
charge and commandment to all masters and owners of schips within
their bounds, to receiue no papists within their schips, to transport
to this countre: and in caice any be receivit, to present their
names immediatly after their arryvall unto the said Magistrates and
Kirk, that order may be taken with them, under such strait paines
and acts as they can best devyse; as they will declare themselves
zealous of God’s glory, and promoters of the word of his Sone Jesus
Christ.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sessio 4.</p>

<p>The Kirk ordayns the Elderschip of Dumfermling to call before
them, Robert Aytowne of Inchbervy, to giue confessione of his
faith; and if he refuises, to proceed against him conforme to the
King’s proclamation and acts of the Kirk.</p>

<p>Forsuameikle as the Kirk understands, that there is certaine papists
in Camphier, that not only troubles the congregatione of the
Scottishe natione, but also the Fleymingis, and will not submitt
themselves to the censures of the Kirk, be reasone of their alleadged
priviledges: heirfore the haill Kirk of Scotland, in ane
voyce, gives their full power and commissione to the minister of
Camphier, to proceid against them, as they ought to doe therein
themselves; requestand also the Conservator to hold hand unto the
Kirk, that order may be had against them.</p>

<p class="p1 center">Sessio 5.</p>

<p>Mr Mark Kar, my Lord of Requests, presentit ane letter to the
Assemblie from His Majestie, the substance whairof is conteinit in
the Articles after following.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Articles from his Majestie.</p>

<p>1. Qwhither think ye that all benefices under Prelacies, newlie
provydit since the King’s corronatione, sould pay any thrid, or no
thrid?</p>

<p>2. If some sould pay thrids, and some nane, what shall be the
difference?</p>

<p>3. Should not all benefices presentit to Ministers and Readers before
the first day of November 1581, be allowit in their year’s stipends
from the same day of the first day of November 1582; and
if ye think that there shall be any difference be reasone of the annat
or utherwayes, that ye declare it?</p>

<p>4. Should not all persones presentit and admittit to benefices in
this tyme, be placed in the book of Modificatione, as Ministers or
Readers, the kirks belangand to the same benefices?</p>

<p>5. Aucht such, being ministers, as hes sufficient ecclesiasticall
livings of their awne, be reasone of benefices qwhairunto they are
provydit for their lifetymes, take stipends to serve at uther kirks?</p>

<p>6. Think ye it not convenient, that the Reports answering to the
King’s Majestie’s letter, send over all the realme this last summer,
shall be sein and considerit at this tyme, for the better understanding
of the estates of the kirks, and to see how many of the same reports
are in your awne hands, for so many as the Clerk of Register
hes shall be readie and patent?</p>

<p>7. That ye latt us wnderstand what ye haue thocht meit and
concludit, anent the Readers in generall, and speciallie Readers that
are presentit to viccarages for their lyfetymes?</p>

<p>8. Think ye it reasone, that any presentit to the title of a benefice,
and serving as minister and reader at the only kirk belonging
to the same benefice, shall haue any manner of allowance or stipend
nor the rent of the selfe same benefice?</p>

<p>9. What think ye most readie and possible to sustaine the colledge
kirks?</p>

<p>10. To qwhom think ye the King’s Majestie and the lawit patrones
sould direct the presentationes for admitting qualifiet persones<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
to such benefices as shall happen to vaike, be the deceiss of
the present possessors of them, and that ye will name the persones
in speciall?</p>

<p>11. Seeing the dearth of victualls maks great inequalitie of stipends,
some haveing victuall allowit for ane mark or xx. shilling,
and uthers of that silver assignit to them, constraint to buy at 5 or
6, or sumtymes 7 merks the boll; were it not agrieable to equitie
that all ministers had their proportionall part of victuall and money,
or else that the victuall sould be sauld or allowit at the hyest
pryce, qwherthrough such as hes small stipends may be the better
augmented?</p>


<p class="p1 center">Answers to the Articles.</p>

<p>1, 2. To the first and second: before they be speciallie answerit,
it is thocht meitest, that there be ane forme of assignatione made be
some to be appoyntit thereto, betwixt and the next Assemblie, to
all kirks and ministers that are licklie to stand and continow, respectand
the answers and advyce sent out of everie countrie, and as
if the present possessors were dead; and that chairges be direct to
such as hes not sent their answer, to send them with expeditione.</p>

<p>3. It is thocht meitest that the intrant to any benefice shall enter
and serve the cure of the kirk thereof, at the next first day of
November, after his admission at the next Whitsonday, and shall
have no farder stipend for this year, but the taxt or superplus, as it
falls; because his executors will fall alse meikle at his deceiss, according
to the ancient order of the annatt: and that diligence be
done to gett rowis of all benefices taxt; and qwhatever benefices
are not taxed, the rents thereof the first year to be devydit
equallie betwixt the executors of the defunct and the intrant;
qwhilk intrant shall only have the half fruits of the year of intrantie,
and sicklyke of the stipends.</p>

<p>4. We think nane sould be placit in the book of modificatione
but worthie and qualified persones; and if any be presentit or admittit
to benefices since the King’s coronatione, that are unworthie
or unable to discharge their dewtie, that they be callit and depryvit,
be such order as shall heirafter be condescendit upon.</p>

<p>5. For the generall, we think that such being ministers, as hes
sufficient livings of their awne, be reasone of benefices qwhereunto
they are provydit for their lyfetymes, sould not take stipends to
serve at uther kirks, without great necessitie seen and allowit be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
the General Assemblie; and upon the speciall knawledge of the
persones that are not able in this head, order shall be taken to reforme
them as appertayneth.</p>

<p>6. We think this thing most necessar and agrieable to that
qwhilk is appoyntit in the answer to the first and secund articles.</p>

<p>7. This article shall be speciallie answerit, how soon it may be
advysed be the Generall Assemblie.</p>

<p>8. Upon the sicht of the forme of the particular assignation to be
made, and what particular causes shall fall under this rule, We shall
give our speciall answer heirunto, qwhilk is concludit, and will depend
upon the answer to be made to the first and second articles.</p>

<p>9. We cannot but think it reasonable, that the Colledge Kirks be
also weill provydit of ane minister as wther kirks; and thinks, that
in making new assignationes for the next year, the ministers of the
Kirks of the Colledges, sould be assigned for his stipend upon the
fruits of the same kirks, alseweill being assignit to the help of the
Colledge wtherwayes, or then the Colledge to haue the rents of the
kirks as before, and the minister to haue his assignatione utherwayes.</p>

<p>10. The presentation to be directit to the Commissioners of the
Kirk within whais bounds the benefices lyes.</p>

<p>11. This matter is weightie, and touches manie, and cannot be
weil answerit be us, without the advyce of the Assemblie, to
qwham it shall be proponit, and thereafter resolute answer given.</p>

<p>As the examination and admission of Ministers within this realme
is, be act of Parliament, ordaynit to be in the power of the kirk, now
openly and publickly professt within this realme, so it is thocht, that
the deprivatione of ministers is in the power of the same kirk, and
them that admitts and examinats them, ministers.</p>

<p>Towards the deprivatione of Bischops admittit since the King’s
coronatione: it is thocht meit that the same be lykewyse in the
power of the Kirk, and them that examinats, elects, and admitts
Bischops, and the same deprivatione alseweell to extend from this
functione of the ministrie as from the benefice itself and fruits
thereof, qwhairthrough the same may be declaired vacand, and
to be presentit and conferrit of new, as if he were naturallie dead.</p>

<p>Causes of deprivatione we take it to be&mdash;heresie, papistrie, common
blasphemie, perjurie, adulterie, fornicatione, incest, slauchter,
theft, common oppression, common drunkenness, wsurie against the
lawes of the realm, nonresidence and absence from his flock and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
office be the space of fourtie dayes together in ane year, without
lawfull impediment allowit be the Generall Assemblie; pluralitie of
benefices provydit sen the King’s coronatione, to be cause of deprivatione
from them all except ane, that the possessors will astrict
themselves to make residence at the same; dilapidatione of the
rents of benefices contrare the act of Parliament; simonie: For
the forme of deprivatione, ane lybellit precept on fourtie dayes
warning within the realme, and within sixty dayes being without
the realme, to be direct to the Kirk and such Commissioners thereof,
as elects and admitts the persone complaint on&mdash;summonding
him to compeir and answer upon the complaint; and, in caice of
his absence at the first summonds, the second to be directit upon
the lyke warnyng, with certification if he failzie, the lybell shall be
admittit to probation, and he shall be haden <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro confesso</i>. Efter
the decreit gine, if the persone against qwham it is gine think himselfe
wrangouslie grevit thereby, it shall be leisum to him to interpone
appellatione to the next Generall Assembly, and intimat the
same within ten dayes, utherwayes the decreit to receive present
executione.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sessio 6.</p>

<p>Anent the questione moveit to the Assembly, If the Generall
Kirk hes power to revoke whatsoever things done be them, or any
particular member of the same, to the hurt and prejudice of the
Kirk, or not?</p>

<p>The brethren, after reasonyng and disputting in the matter, at
lenth votit <em>affirmative</em> in the questione&mdash;that the Kirk hes power
to doe the same.</p>

<p>Anent the summonds raisit, to this day, by the Elderschip of
Striviling against Mr Robert Montgomrie, minister ther of sumtyme,
to heir the sentence of suspensione gine in against him from
the ministrie allowit be the Generall Assembly; and farder to the
clause concernyng his life, manners, and doctrine, and uther things
qwhilks the said Assembly sould lay to his charge; as the summonds
at length beares: The said Mr Robert being present, and
requyrit to answer heirto, before all protestit, that if the Kirk proceeded
in any thing against him, or charge him without warrand
of the word of God, for remead and answering to the summonds,
albeit the Generall Kirk sould not allow any thing deduced in the
said proces; because he was never lawfullie summoned thereto,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
knew nothing thereof his suspension from the ministrie, but the
only bruit, nor never was the samen intimat to him, and in so farr as
the proces being personall, intimation to him of the said suspension,
took instrument thereupon, and offerit to improve the samen in that
poynt: With all the qwhilks alleadgences, the Kirk and brether
weell advysit, notwithstanding thereof, Finds the said proces, decreit
and intimatione thereof, ordourly deducit and proceidit, and the
said suspensione well proceidit and gine; reserving nottheless to
the said Mr Robert, in the secund instance, to sute reductione and
remeid, as appertayneth.</p>

<p>Being farther accused of contraventioune of the said sentence of
suspensione be preaching of the word, and ministratione of the
sacraments afoir the intimation thereof, he granted the same, but
pretended ignorance of the giving of the said sentence.</p>

<p>Before farther reasonyng in this matter, my Lord of Requests
presentit to the Kirk, a wryting sent from the King’s Majestie unto
them, to declare that his Majestie’s will was, That the Kirk should
not trouble the said Mr Robert for any thing concernyng the bischoprick,
or that may result thereupon, or of any uther cause bygane,
committit be him; but that it might be handlit before his Grace:
Qwhilk being reverently receavit and read in open Assemblie, the
breither praisit God that movit the King’s heart, to send his Commission
to the Assemblie; and as to the action present, with the
assistance of God, such attendance sould be gine thereto for his
Grace’s request, that nothing sould be handlit belonging to the civill
power, and nothing but uprichtlie, sincerly, and with the just judgement
pronuncit against him, as they sould answer to God and his
heines.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sessio 7.</p>

<p>Hereafter ane plaine and lange discourse was made openly, of
the haill diligence of the brether to qwhom Commissione was gine
in the last Assemblie, concernyng the said Mr Robert, and the copies
of the charges given to them at his instance, producit, declareing
and bearing effectuouslie, witnessing of his knowledge of the said
suspensioune, albeit he plainly protestit before God, he never knew
of the raising of any of the said charges or executiones thereof;
with the qwhilk discourse and confessione of the said Mr Robert,
that he had preachit and administrat the sacraments sen the said
decreit of suspensione; The Kirk being advysit, in ane voyce, after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
voting, ffand the said decreit and sentence violat be him, and superceidit
to decerne upon the paine of the said contraventione, qwhill
the morne that the brether first conveining.</p>

<p>The said Mr Robert demandit the answer of the haill Kirk, if
they wald accuse him of any thing concerning the Bischoprick or
any thing resulting thereupone: 2dly, That he might have the copy
of the large discourse made verballie be the brethren, to the effect
he might answer simply to every poynt thereof.</p>

<p>Being removit out of the Assembly, within a little space thereafter
compeirit John Burne, messenger, and be vertew of our Soveraigne
Lord’s Letters, delyvrit be the Lords of Secreit Councill, inhibit and
dischargit the brethren of the Generall Assembly, the Moderator and
his Assessors, from directing any citations against Mr Robert Montgomrie,
as is therein contenit, wsing of excommunication, innovatione,
sclandering or troubling of him in his ministrie, for aspyring
to the Bischoprick of Glasgow, or calling or persewing of his breither
for the same, or for any promise made be them thereanent, or
any uther thing dependand thereupon, in tyme bygane, under the
paine of rebellion, and putting of them to the horne; certifyand
them and they failzie, he wald denunce them our Soveraigne Lord’s
rebells, and put them to his heines horne: of the qwhilk charge he
delyverit instantly ane copie qwhilk he subscrived with his awne
hand.</p>

<p>The said Mr Robert being callit again, and being absent, the
brether ordaynit Mr Thomas M‘Kgill to warne him the morne.</p>

<p>Anent the age of persones that shall hereafter enter in the ministrie
of the word: seeing that sundry hes been intrusit upon the
Kirk, and presentit to benefices having cure, that be reasone of their
young yeares and laick of experience and judgement, that cannot
be able to discharge that high and sacred vocatione, qwherunto they
are callit; The Kirk of ane mynd hes votit and concludit, that in
tyme cuming, naine be admittit to the functione of the ministrie,
nor collationat, nor admittit to any benefice of cure, without they be
of the age of twenty-fyve yeares, except such that for singular and
rare qualities into them, shall be judgit be the Generall Assembly
meit and worthie thereof.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sessio 8.</p>

<p>Anent the ordinance made yesternight concerning the summonding
of Mr Robert Montgomrie, to compeir before the Assembly this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
day at ten houres: the said Mr Robert being callit and not compearand,
but be William Montgomrie his alleadgit procurator,
qwha producit ane appellatione qwhereof the tenor heirafter will
appear.</p>

<p>Compearit Mr Robert M‘Kgill, and declareit, that at command
of the Assembly, he warnit him yesternight to compear at this houre,
before the haill Kirk, personallie, in presence of Mrs Walter Hay,
John Cowper, and Andrew Ker, and that he promised to compeir
personallie at the hour appoyntit, qwhilks the said brether and witnesses
testified to be trew.</p>

<p>Hereafter was certaine speciall and innorme crymes producit and
read, qwhairof he was alleadgit to be guiltie. 1. Negligence and
corruptione in doctrine, also dissollutione in lyfe, for the qwhilk he
was suspendit; contraveining of the suspensione in Glasgow, Strivelling,
and in the King’s owne chappell; violating of his promise
made to the Presbytrie of Striviling, that he sould remaine and
wait upon his cure; horrible lies in the face of the Assemblie, denying,
with protestatione before God, the intimatione of the suspension,
and raiseing and executing the letters; procureing of letters be
sinister informatione for overthrowing the discipline of the Kirk;
usurping an uther man’s flock, accompanied with armed men since
the suspensione; chairging of the haill Assemblie, under the payne
of hornyng, to stay with all proceiding against him with excommunicatione;
blasphemous railing against the brether and ministrie in
pulpit, sen his suspensione, and of before; and, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in summa</i>, manifest
contempt of the ordinance of the Kirk, and stirring up of ane fearfull
schisme betwixt certain of the nobilitie and the Kirk: Qwhilk
being tryit, pairtlie be his awne confessione, pairtly be the proces
deducit be the Generall Assembly halden last in Edinburgh, and be
the proces deducit before the Elderschip of Striveling, and partly be
the testimonie of good and godlie brethren of the Assemblie, were
found all to have falline in his persone, and him to be culpable and
guiltie thereof: for the qwhilks haynous, fowll, and most unworthie
crymes, the Assemblie of the brether votit and concludit the said
Robert, not only unworthie to serve in the office of the ministrie,
but to be depryvit thereof perpetuallie, in all tyme cuming; and the
sentence of excommunication to strick upon him, without he prevent
the same be repentance.</p>

<p>My Lord of Requests cravit of the Kirk, that the pronouncing of
the said sentence sould be superseidit qwhill the King’s Majestie<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>

<p>We have receavit your Grace’s maist loving letter, direct to us
by your Grace’s Commissioner, Mr Mark Ker, Mr of Requests,
and are compellit to burst out most humble thanks to our God,
qwho of his mercie hes gine us so godlie ane King, cairfull and
weill willing that God be glorified, and his Kirk, within your Majestie’s

but in such shortness of tyme and great strait whereunto we
are brought be certaine letters raisit at the instance of Mr Robert
Montgomrie, we are altogether stayit in that and many uther godlie

under the paine of hornyng, commandit the haill Kirk from all proceiding
against him, for whatsoever cause or enormitie committit
in these his wicked attempts; a thing that was never heard nor
seen since the world began; whairof we man lament unto your Majestie:
And having no uther refuge under God, most humblie
cravis, that be thir extraordinary chairges direct against the word
of God and lawes of your Grace’s countrie, we be not constraint,

that, be such dealing, goes about to draw your Majestie’s heart
from your trew and faithfull subjects, and be this unhappie schisme,
to overthraw the Kirk of God within your Grace’s countrey, and,
for their awne particular gaines, banische Christ and his word,
(whilk God of his infinite mercy forbid,) and preserve your Grace,
body and saul, for ever.&mdash;From St Androis, the 28th of Apryle,
1582.</p>

<p>As to the sentence to be gine against Mr Robert Montgomrie,
and the enormities conteint in the acts preceiding, The Assemblie
and brethrene present, after voteing in the said matter, depryvit
the said Mr Robert from all functione of the ministrie in the Kirk
of God, dureing the will of the Assemblie; and farder, decernit the
sentence of fearfull excommunicatione to be pronouncit in face of
the whole Assembly, be the voyce and mouth of the Moderator
present, against him; To the effect that his proud flesche, being
cast in the hands of Satane, he may be winne againe, if it be possible,

<p>Anent the conferrence had yesternight with Mr Robert Montgomrie;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
to the effect that the brethren might understand what fruit
had followit thereof:&mdash;First, they demanded of him, in presence of

his charge of before, qwho, after prayer to God to be mercifull to
him, grantit and confessit as after followes:&mdash;ffirst, He confest the
command gine him be the Reader of Striviling to desist from his

remembers not that ever he preached it: 4. Grants he made promise
to the Presbytrie of Striviling to await on his charge of the

could not haue the process of his suspensione: 6. Declareit that
howbeit he knew the raising of many of the letters against the breither,
yet he keepit the ordinarie dyetts thereof: 7. Grants the
usurpatione of Mr David Weymes’ flock, qwhairin he confest that
he had heavily offendit: 8. And sicklyke grants he hes heavilie
offendit against God and his Kirk, be procureing and raiseing the

Bischoprick of Glasgow, without advyce thereof. The said Assemblie,
in proceeding be this forme of doing qwhilk he hes used&mdash;ffor
the qwhilk he submitts himself in the will of the brethrene, willing
to abyde their judgement, and to obey and underly such injunctiones
as they will ordayne therefore.</p>

<p>And as to his simple meaning concernyng the estate of Bischops,
and corruptione thereof; being requyrit openly, in the fear of God
and uprightness of conscience, to declare the same, desyrit to conferr
with Mrs James Lawsone, John Craige, Robert Pont, David
Lyndsay, and the Laird of Culluchie, to the effect he might be
farther resolvit, and give his simple meaning therein to the Kirk,

The said actione and haill proces being publickly read and at

In wryting thir outrageous words therein&mdash;pretendit Presbytrie,
usurpitance of the said Presbytrie, without any ground of God’s

their awne consciences, and Christiane charitie&mdash;that some of them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>

gives not absolute obedience, according to the tennor of this sentence,
in all poynts, that the said Presbytrie of St Androis proceed

maist wrangouslie withholden from him, be the wickit and fraudulent
meanes of the present possessor thereof; Nottheless, that ungodlie

not suffered your suite to be heard, tryit, and allowit be his Majestie,
as he is sure it will be qwhensoever his Grace shall be dewlie
informit of his innocencie, and the miseries, grieves, and wrangs be

dolences to his Majestie, that they will yet continew their former sute
in his favour, and pretermit to the present opportunitie of his Majestie’s
good dispositione, not able to be abused be the craft and
subtilitie of that his unjust enemie being presentlie removit from his
Majestie’s presence; praying them also to labour that his body and
living may be committit to the custodie of his very undoubtit friends,
qwho will have unfeigned care for the preservatione of the ane and
wther, according to conscience, equity, and righteous lawes of all
civill countries;&mdash;Remembring presently that he is so destitute of
all wther meines of intercessione, saving them only, through fear
of his enemies crueltie, that among so many naturall friends of all
degrees, he can hardly finde ane who will declare himself the presenter
of this his supplicatione made to the said Assemblie: the
qwhilk necessitie he doubts not their Wisdomes will worthilie supplie.</p>

<p>The Kirk having considerit the said supplicatione, Ordaynes

compells us presently to haue recourse unto your Majestie, percewing
many things to fall furth, greatly to the prejudice of God’s
Glory, and no small appearance of utter wrack of this his Kirk and
Commonwealth, unless some heastie remead be put thereto; most
humblie, therefore, beseikand your Majestie diligently to weighe
and consider thir few heids, qwhilks, with all reverence and observance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
we present, looking for graceous answer and speedy redress
thereof.</p>

<p>1. It is ane great griefe to the hearts of all these that fears God,
that apostates, sworne enemies to Christ, your Grace, and all your
faithfull subjects, forfault for their treasone&mdash;some also suspect and
bruitit with the murther of the most noble persone of your umquhill
father&mdash;impugners of the truth be word and wreite&mdash;continuing
still in their wickedness, unreconcilit to the Kirk, to receave of your
Majestie the benefite of pacificatione to the prejudice of the
faithfull ministers, qwham violently be their meanes they labour to
dispossesse.</p>

<p>2. That wthers from their youth, nurischit in the Kirk of God,
with us, and sensyne fearfullie fallen back therefrae, and become greit
runnagats, and blasphemers of the truth, and maintainers of idolatrie,
and that Man of Sinne, Liutennant of Satane, and oppressors of
God’s people; and yet, notwithstanding, are receivit in court, authorised,
and so far countenanced, that they are becum familiars
with your Majestie, qwhairthrough, besyde the grief of your Majestie’s
subjects, many are brought to doubt qwhat shall ensew upon
such beginnyngs.</p>

<p>3. That a wicked obstinate Papist sent in the countrie to traffique
against God and quyetness of your Grace’s estate, and therefore is
worthy of death, committit in ward at your Grace’s command, with
sure promise that he sould not escape punischment, yet as we understand,
was, be indirect meanes, let depart, and no tryall taken of
the author of his delyverie.</p>

<p>4. That your Majestie seems to have over great lyking of the
enemies of God, alsewell in France as some within this realme,
who hes never gine testimony of any good meining aither in religione
or in your Majestie’s seruice, have succeidit to men that were
knawne zealous in God’s cause, and faythfull to your Grace from
your tender age.</p>

<p>5. Sen your Majestie took the government in your awne hand,
many fair promises hes been made that order should be taken for
preservatione of the Kirk of God, and continuance thereof to the
posteritie: yet, after lang and continuall sute, nothing is performed;
but in place of redress, daily the Kirk is bereft of her priviledges
and liberties.</p>

<p>6. The thirds are sett in tack for soumes of money, in defraud of
the Kirk, so that no minister hereafter can be provydit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span></p>

<p>7. Abbacies are disponit, without any provisione made for the
ministers serving in the Kirks annexit thereto, directlie against the
act of Parliament.</p>

<p>8. Spirituall livings are gine to bairnes, and translatit in temporall
lordships.</p>

<p>9. That there is no punischment of incest, adulterie, witchcrafts,
murthers, abominable oathes, and uther horrible oathes, in such
sorte that daily some increases and provockes the wrath of God
against the haill countrie.</p>

<p>10. There is a sair murmuring against your Grace’s leiges, and
a lamentable complaint that the lawes of the countrie have no place&mdash;that
no man can be sure neither of his lands, lyfe, nor goods,
qwhilk threatens ane miserable confusione, and the heavie hand of
God to insew thereupon.</p>

<p>11. That oftentymes your Majestie interpones your Heines’ authoritie,
be letters of hornyng, to stope the executione of the acts
made in the Generall Assemblie, in matters properly belonging to
the Kirk, and nothing touching the civill estate.</p>

<p>12. Lastly, we most humblie beseik your Majestie to suffer us to
lament the great divisione amongest your Heines’ nobilitie and subjects&mdash;the
ane pairt seeking be all meanes possible, for their awne
particulars, to persuade your Majestie to wrack the uther, qwhilk
fosters ane continuall stryfe, malice, and rancour, to the great danger
of your Grace’s persone, qwham God preserve to keep the
Kirk of God and this poor countrie: beseiking your Majestie, for
the tender mercy of God, to call to your Heines, some of the most
wyse, discreet, and indifferent, to be your Councill; to take a moderate
course, that unquiet spirits may be brydlit, good men cherishit
and intertained, and the hearts of all your Majestie’s subjects
unite, to the maintenance of God’s glory, preservation of your
Royall estate, and comfort of all them that bewaill this miserable
dissolutione.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Particular Instructiones, and maire full Declarations giuen be
the Generall Assemblie to their Commissioners, direct to
the King’s Majestie, the 13th of October, upone every heid
of the Articles generally proponit.</p>
</div>

<p>1. First, How heavilie the godlie are offendit, and the haill Kirk
sclanderit, that Mr David Chalmers, a man notoriously knawne
unto his Grace’s Counsell to be not only a formall and professt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
enemie against the truth of Christ’s religione, a plaine practizer
and traffiquer against the same, but also against his Heines’ authoritie
and estate, in all partes qwhair he hes travellit; having herewith,
resting upon his head, the foul bruite and common suspitione
conceiveit in the hearts of many men, upon no small or obscure
presumptiones, of the cruell and most barbarous murther of the
most noble persone of your Majestie’s umqwhill father, of good
memory&mdash;sould be so suddenly and with so small accompt enterit
in fauour, and receiue his Majestie’s pacificatione, with Letters to
dispossess faithfull servants and ministers of God of their livings
and possessiones, no dew satisfactione beand made to the Kirk; a
matter no less importing great prejudice to his Heines’ noble estate,
then touching his Majestie in the highest poynt of his honor; and
therefore his Honour would be moued wisely to looke upon the
consequence thereof, in consideratione of his weightie grief, wald
call back and suspend the force and effect of any thing yet grantit
to him, and the charges gine to his repossessione, unto the tyme
that just and lawfull tryell of his innocencie be cognoscit, and the
haill Kirk, so farr offendit in his persone, be satisfyit, and the same
satisfactione be returned from the Kirk to his Grace.</p>

<p>2. The young Laird of Fintrie, direct unto this countrie, as we
are surely informit, to practise with his Grace and faithfull subjects
for overthrow of religione, be moyen of friends cruppen in Court,
and qwherever he comes, plainly maintaines Papistrie, and, under
collour of conferrence, qwhill be all meines he flyes, does great
sclander in this countrie.</p>

<p>3. The third article is notour.</p>

<p>4. Be the fourth article is meined the King of France, the Duke
of Guise, and uther Papists thair; and lykewise, within the countrie,
the Earles of Huntlie, Crawford, and uthers. The Kirk is hurt in
their liberties and priviledges sundrie wayes, as will appear in the
Articles, as follow: Tacks of the thrids of Haddingtone and St
Androis, sett to the Laird of Seagy: The Abbacie of Abberbrothock
is disponit to the Duke, and no provisione for the minister:
The Abbacie of Hallyrudehouse to the Abbot’s young sone: Sicklyke,
the Abbot of Newbottle found provydit to the 9 and 10
notor;&mdash;as, for example, Mr George Gairden being provydit to the
parsonage of Fordyce in the 68 yeir of God, and yet standing
titular there: The King’s Majestie hes sett in tack the fruits of the
saids benefices to Robert Stewart of Todlaw, and command giuen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
to the Lords of Session to grant Letters upon the said tacks: Mr
Alexander Arbuthnott is chairgit, against the Acts of the Kirk, to
remaine in the Colledge of Aberdeene, under the paine of hornyng:
The Ministers of the Chapters of Halyrudehouse are chairgit be
letters of hornyng to subscryve the gift of pensione made to the
persone of Pennycuik, his wife and sone, for their lyfetymes; Sicklyke
against the said Act anent the Act made one the penult day
of October 1576. Concernyng setting of fewes and tacks of benefices
and ecclesiasticall livings, or any part thereof, be such as
beare functione in the ministrie, The Generall Assembly, as of before,
ratifies and approves the said Act, with this declaratione, that
under the said Act, all suspenseones, factories, and whatsoever
other dispositione of the benefice, or any part thereof, without the
consent of the Generall Assemblie, is and shall be comprehendit in
tyme cuming, and that the disponers thereupon shall incurre the
penaltie contained in the Act of the date of the 12th of July 1578,
Sess. 6.</p>

<p>It is cravit be the Synod of Lawthiane, that this Assembly take
order with Mr John Spotswood for setting of the tack of his benefice,
butt consent of the Assemblie. The Kirk ordaynes this particular
to be tryit in his awne Presbytrie, and the tryall to be reportit
to the next Generall Assembly.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, That this Assembly ratifie the dissolutione of the Presbytrie
of Haddingtoune, and unione of the members thereof with
uther presbytries, be reasone of many enormities occurrand there&mdash;as
rare convention of the brether, loathsomeness and contempt of
the word in the people, and not executing the Acts of the Assembly:
qwhilk head the Kirk approves for the present.</p>

<p>Forsuameikle as sundrie of the penitents, pairtly for poverty,
sickness, or distance of place, are unable to compeir before the provinciall
Assembly&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quæritur</i>, If they may compeir before the
Elderschip? Answer: It is not thocht good presently.</p>

<p>The Elders of the Elderschip of Melros are of diverse judgements&mdash;some
craving the Assembly to continow there&mdash;others to
ane uther place, or else to devyde it. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quæritur</i>, Qwhat shall be
best? Answer: They have liberty as they think best, so it be
done with common consent.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sessio 7.</p>

<p>It is thocht expedient that the four Presbytries in Lawthiane be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
joynit in ane Provinciall Assemblie, and that Dunbar, Churnside,
Melross, and Peebles, be joynit in ane uther, and the place of their
next Assemblie to be in Lawder, and thereafter to be changit, as
they shall think expedient.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sessio 11.</p>

<p>Ministers that beiris with the people repairing in pilgrimage to
wells hard besyde their awne houses, not reproving them, but rather
entertayning them with meat and drink in their houses&mdash;distributing
the communion to their flocks, and not communicating with
them be the space of seven or eight yeares&mdash;such persones deserves
deprivatione.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sessio 13.</p>

<p>The Generall Assemblie gives licence to the persone of Hauch,
to passe out of the countrie for recoverie of his health, the King’s
Majestie’s licence being obteinit thereto, and his awne kirk provydit
at the sicht of the Presbytrie of Dumbar.</p>

<p>Forsuameikle as sundrie Acts hes past of before, to close the
hands of beneficed persones within the ministrie, that they sett no
tacks of the benefices, or any part thereof, or make uther dispositione
thereof qwhatsomever, without the advyce of the haill Kirk, yet
daily supplicationes are gine in to the Kirk for thair consent to be
had thereto, howbeit, both for schortness of tyme and utherwayes,
the estate of such supplicationes cannot be conveniently reasonit
and tryit before them: Heirfore it is thocht expedient that qwhaire
any such is to be made, that the samen be first presentit to the
particular presbytries whair the benefices lyis, wham before the
tryall shall be taken, oath of the old kyndness and title of the supplicant,
and of the estate of the benefice&mdash;qwhat was of old, rentall
thereof&mdash;qwhat present&mdash;and the pairts and tryall thereof reportit
againe to the Generall Assemblie&mdash;qwhat order may be tane with
the sute according to equitie: and lykewayes ordayns every presbytrie,
within their awne jurisdictione, to try and examine what
persons hes broken the act made against beneficit persones within
the ministrie, that setts tacks or fewes, or makes uther dispositiones
whatsumever of their benefices, or any part thereof, against the
Acts of the Assemblie; and, after calling of parties, and dew triall
taine, to report their names, with the proces, to the next Assemblie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span></p>

<p>The proces led be the Presbytrie of St Androis against Alysone
Peirsone, with the proces led against Mr Patrick Adamsone before
the presbytrie forsaid, and also the proces of the Synodall of Fyffe,
to justifie the accusatione led against the said Mr Patrick, was exhibite.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sessio 14.</p>

<p>Forsuameikle as in reading in schooles, of prophane authors,
qwherin many things are written, directly impugning the grounds
of religion, and speciallie in the Philosophie of Aristotle, oft tymes
the youth being curious and of insolent spirits, drinks in erroneous
and damnable opiniones, and founding them upon the bruckle authoritie
of the prophane wryters, and maintayns their godless and
prophane opiniones, obstinatly in disputation and utherwayes, to
the great sclander of the word of God, and offence of the simple
and unlearnit: Thairfore, it is provydit, after reasonyng and good
advyce, be universall consent agreit, that in all tymes coming, the
maisters, regents, and teachers of the scholers in reading of prophane
authors, shall vigilantly take heid if there be any thing alleadgit
or written in them against the grounds and heads of Religione,
and, in teaching thereof, to mark and note the places evict,

<p>The King’s Majestie’s Answers unto the heids presentit to his
Heines from the Generall Assemblie of the Kirk.</p>
</div>

<p class="right"><em>At Striveling, the 17 of October, 1583.</em></p>

<p>His Majestie having considerit the heids, and conferrit with the
messenger, touching the meaning and explication of the generalitie
thereof, Understanding the first poynt to be gatherit, of the granting
of the benefite of pacificatione be his Heines to Mr David Chalmers:
His Majestie knawing that man only to have beene forfaultit,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
for that commone actione of his being at the field of Langsyde,
for qwhilk pardon wes grantit to so many, thocht it no new or
strange thing, at the request of such as movit his Grace, to grant
unto him the lyke benefite, as many wthers for the lyke cause had
of before obtained: yet no wayes intending to spare the dew punischment
of him or any wthers that may be chargit or fund culpable
of the murther of his Heines’ dearest ffather, or that are or shall
be adversars of the religione, and impugners thereof, against his
Hienes’ lawes made thereanent, the executione of qwhilks his Majestie
hes been, is, and will be, willing to further.</p>

<p>The second heid generallie conceavit; being particularly meinit of
the young Laird of Fintrie, His Majestie wishes the Assemblie to
remember how his Heines had dealt in this matter, and qwhat testimoniall
the Kirk of Edinburgh grantit unto him. His Majestie
hes not hinderit the proceedings of the Kirk against him, nor no
uthers, but meins to hold hand thereto, according to the laws.</p>

<p>The third head being speciallie meant of ane William Holt, Inglishman,
that escapit out of the Castle of Edinburgh, His Majestie
hes answerit the Queen of England’s embassadour, who movit his
Grace in that matter not lang syne. It is not ane uncouth thing
to hear such ane man escait; alwayes what they understand be ane
indirect meanes used for letting him depart, his Majestie being speciallie
informit thereof, will, after dew tryall, see the offenders punischit
according to their deservyngs.</p>

<p>The fourth head being very generall, his Majestie thinks the Assemblie
will not think it pertinent for them to haue vote in the chusing
of his Majestie’s servants, or to be over curious of the occasione
of the placeing or removeing of them, neither yet of the intelligence
betwixt his Heines and any forraigne countries, for enterteyning of
civill peace and amitie, ffrom the quhilk na princes nor commonwealthes
in the world abstaines, although being diverse in religione.</p>

<p>The fifth head concernyng the generall complaynt upon some
speciall matters appeirandly expressit in the matters following:&mdash;His
Majestie wishes the Assembly, as they wald be speciallie and
directly answerit, so to forme their petitions, fforbearing any particular
examples, to ground generall propositions, and to remember
that his Majestie took the Government in his awne persone, there
is no good and profitable lawes made for the advancement of the
Kirk, and trew religione, nor of before, the default of the executione<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
thereof, and performance of promise notwithstanding in his
Heines’ default.</p>

<p>The sixth, meining especiallie of the Tack sett to the Laird of
Seagy of certaine victualls furth of the superplus of the thrids,
qwhilk he had of before in pensione,&mdash;that was nae new forme, nor
any wayes prohibite. He could alseweill content him with the pensione,
as he had it of before, frie of all payment of dewtie. The
necessar considerationes that movit the granting thereof, are weill
enough knawne to many. He is imployit in publick service, wanting
the living qwhairunto he is provydit in title, dureing his father’s
lyfetyme, and his service is, and may be, necessar both for his Heines
and the Kirk.</p>

<p>For any thing that may be thocht omittit toward provisione of
ministers, serving at the kirks annexit to abbeyes in the late dispositiones
of them, that is well supplied be act of Parliament, the executione
qwhairof hes rather stayed thir twa yeares past in their awne
default, or wtherwayes, they craving to haue their assignationes
continewit, as in the years preceiding, and as yet not haveing directlie
answerit to his Majestie’s message, sent with his Maister of
Requests, to the Assembly halden at St Andrews, &amp;c. Alwayes his
Majestie made choice of certaine barrones, and uthers of good appearance,
knawne zealous to the furtherance of that good wark,
lipning to haue had the assignationes formed before the Assemblie:
But being uncertaine of the tyme appoyntit, therefore, this year, is
doubtful if they cum in Edinburgh, qwhere, if they be, his Heines
shall send directione to them to proceid, or in caise of their absence,
shall appoynt wthers, so as the assignationes may proceid, and so
wther things as are most needfull resolvit, without any farther delay.</p>

<p>Touching giving of spirituall livings to bairnes, and translating
them in temporall lordships, His Majestie considers his awne skaith
and hinderance of his service. Therein qwhatever abuse hes interit
before his Heines acceptit the government, tyme, and the approbationes
of such provisiones be decreits of the Sessione, hes brought
the matter to that estate, as it cannot be utherwayes helpit then be
the Parliament, qwhom unto these being proponit, his Majestie sould
hald hand to haue such reformatione in this behalfe as possiblie can
be obtaynit.</p>

<p>The default of punischment of wthers mentionat in the nynt head,
and of the Act of Provisione of the Poore and Punisching of Vagabonds,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
man not be justly impute to his Hienes, qwho hes ever
been willing and readie to grant commissione to such as the ministers
thocht meitest to execute the same, qwherin inabilitie was in
the judges ordinar.</p>

<p>The tenth heid being generall, His Majestie wald be glad not
only to haue it explainit, but to hear all good advyces that shall be
offerit to him for the reformatione of that qwhilk shall be found
amiss, and how his lawes may have place, and justly ministrat to
the comfort and commone benefite of all his good subjects.</p>

<p>The elevinth head is also very generall, and for the only one example
that hes beene spoken of to his Heines, touching the removeing
of the Principall of the Colledge of Aberdeine to be minister of
St Androis, His Majestie trusts the Assembly will not think that
matter, the substance weill considerit, either so proper to the Kirk,
or so improper to the civill estate, but that his Hines and Counsell
had good ground and reasone to direct his letters as he did upon
the Generalls of the North Countrie, wharin nane was prejudgit&mdash;seing
their was no charge conteyning power to denunce at the first,
but rather to doe the thing requyrit, or compeir and schaw ane cause
in the contrair.</p>

they find it expedient; quhilk being read and advysit with, the haill
brethren gave consent thereto; of the quhilks articles this is the
tennor:</p>

<p>It is found that all such as the Scripture appoynts Governours of
the Kirk of God, as, namely, Pastors, Doctors, and Elders, may
convene to Generall Assemblies and vote in ecclesiasticall matters;
and all uthers that hath any sute or uther things to propone to the
Assemblie may be there present, to giue in their sutes, and propone
things profitable to the Kirk, and hear reasoning, but shall not vote:
2. There are four offices ordinare sett down to us be the Scripture,
to witt, Pastors, Doctors, Elders, and Deacones, and the name of a
Bischop ought not to be taken as it hath been in Papistrie; but it is
commone to all pastores and ministers.</p>

<p>Mr David Cunninghame, Bischop of Aberdeene, is ordainit to

<p class="p1 center">Sessio 7.</p>

<p>Anent the heids of Visitatione, and circumstances left to farther
consideratione: At the desyre of my Lord Privie Seall, the Assembly
directit Mrs Robert Pont, Andrew Melvill, Thomas Blackburne,
Nicoll Dalgleische, Andrew Polwant, and Thomas Buchanane,
to conferr with the King’s Majestie’s Commissioners thereanent,
and such others matters as shall be communicat unto them.</p>

<p>In presence of the haill Assembly, compeirit my Lord Maxwell,
and declareit, that be the King’s Majestie’s command, he compeirit
before the said Assemblie, as he had found cautione to that effect
before the Counsell to compeare before them this day; and, in respect
of his obedience, protestit his cautioner sould be fred, and
took instruments upon his compearance and protestatione.</p>

<p>The Assembly, in respect they knew not the cause of his compearance,

conferrence halden at Halyrudehouse, betwixt certaine appoyntit
be the King’s Majestie of his Counsell, and certaine of the ministrie
callit be his Grace to that effect; the particulars being openly read,
The brethrene agreit to the first article, it being conceivit in thir

<p>It is condescendit that the name of a Bischop hes a speciall charge

<p>Anent the remanent Articles of the said conferrence: It was
thocht good, first, to lay some grounds to reasone on: And, first,
after reasonyng, it was concludit, that it is lawfull to the Generall
Assemblie, to admitt a pastor or minister having a benefice presentit
be the King’s Majestie unto the same: Sicklyke that visitatione
is in the persone of pastors: <em>Item</em>, The Generall Assembly
may send a man, accompanyed with such as the Presbytrie shall
adjoyne to him in visitatione.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sessio 10.</p>

<p>In answering to the heads of the conferrence had betwixt certaine
of his Majestie’s Councill, and certaine of the brether at his
command, the haill Assemblie declairs, that [by] the name of a
Bischope, they only meine of such a Bischope as is descryvit be
Paull; and swa understanding, they agree with the 3d Article of
the said conferrence. Concernyng the 4th Article, it is agreed,
that the Bischop may be appoyntit be the Generall Assemblie to
visite certaine bounds to be limitat to him; and, in visitatione
thereof, he shall proceed be the advyce of the Synodall Assembly,
and such as they shall adjoyne to him. In receaving of presentationes
and collationes, giving of benefices, he shall proceed be the
advyce and vote of the Presbytrie qwhere the benefice lyis, and of
certaine Assessors to be joynit to him, at the leist of the maist
pairt of the Presbytrie and Assessors, unto the tyme the Presbytrie

The same Assessors, at the first time, shall be nominat be the Generall
Assembly.</p>

Bischops may not overtake the haill bounds, callit of old Diocie,
Commissioners shall be presentit be his Majestie to the Generall
Assemblie, and admittit be them thereto, as the said Bischops are
to theirs, and to be comptable allanerlie to the said Assemblie for
their Commissione; and the Bischops to have no power within
their bounds more than they have within his bounds, The Commissioners,
being elect as said is, to have a like counsell and power in
the execution of their office as the Bischops hes: That the Commissioners
appoyntit to visite in their Presbytries or their particular
kirks, as the Presbytries or Synodall Assemblies think good&mdash;not
prejudging the Presbytrie’s particular visitatione. The same
cause of lyfe and doctrine to depryve a Bischop or Commissioner
that depryves a minister. The 14th Article agreit to. Anent the
Assemblies, the first Article agreit to also.</p>

<p>The Commissioners of the King’s Majestie protestit, in respect
the Assembly had casten down that qwhilk was requyrit in the
Conferrence halden att Halyrudehouse, that nothing be done therein
mair in the said Conferrence, nor this Assembly, have any force or
effect; and namely, in respect they have subject Bischops to the
tryall and censure of the Presbytrie and Synodall Assemblies: In
respect of the qwhilk protestatione, the Assembly immediatly direct
to the King’s Majestie Mrs Robert Pont, James Martine, and
Patrick Galloway, to informe his Grace concerning this matter.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sessio 12.</p>

<p>The brether direct to the King’s Majestie yesternight, reportit,
that his Majestie could not agrie that Bischops and Commissioners
sould be utherwayes tryit then be Generall Assemblie. In respect
of the tyme, the Assemblie hes thocht it expedient, That albeit it
be thocht lawfull and reasonable be them, that the tryall and censuring
of pastores be in the Presbytries qwhair they remain, nottheless,
that the tryall and censuring of such pastors as the Generall
Assembly shall giue Commissione to visit, shall be in the hand
of the said Assembly, or such as they shall deput, qwhill farder
order be taine be the Generall Assembly.</p>

<p>Ordaynes Mr Andrew Melvill to penne a favourable letter to the
French Ministers qwho are to repaire within the countrie to the
King’s Majestie’s licence, assureing them of the travells of the Kirk
at his Hienes’ hand and burrowes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span></p>

<p>Anent the continwance of the Commissione gine to Commissioners
appoyntit be the Generall Assemblie: It is resolvit, that the
saids Commissioners shall continow in that charge for ane year
nixt to come, and from thence furth, according as the said Assemblie
shall think expedient.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sessio 13.</p>

<p>Concerning the appellatione interponit be the Bischop of St Androis
from the proces of the sentence of excommunicatione led and
pronuncit against him be the Synodall Assemblie of Fyfe: It was
thocht meit that Mrs Patrick Galloway and John Duncansone pass
downe to the King’s Majestie, to desyre, if his Grace think good,
that certaine of his Counsell be appoyntit, with certaine of the
brethrene to be nominat be the Assemblie, to sicht the said proces
and appellatione, before the same be brought in publick judgement
and sight of the Assemblie? His Majestie’s answer being returnit,
that he agries unto the said desyre.</p>

<p>Anent Commissione of Visitatione, aither the Bischop or uther:
The Assemblie declaires, that all the saids Commissiones shall
cease and take no effect in tyme comeing, without new Commissione
from the Generall Assembly to them to that effect.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sessio 15.</p>

<p>Ordaynes two or three of every countrie to resort to my Lord
Clerk Register, to visit the platt of ministers’ steipends, and sicklyke
of the Presbytries, and order thereof, qwhere they may giue their
advyce and be best satisfiet. Qwhere the King’s Majestie and his
houss makes residence, it is found meit that they, with his Grace’s
ministers, be of that Presbytrie qwhere they make their residence;
and the samen to be understand of the Nobilitie, their housses and
ministrie.</p>

<p>The Letter ordaynit to be direct to the French Ministers being
read, was thocht meit to be written over and delyverit to Monsieur
Muline, under the subscriptione of the Moderator and Clark.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sessio 16.</p>

<p>Forsuameikle as, in the Conferrence, some things were thocht
meit to be proponed to the Assemblie, concernyng the matter of
the appellatione of the Synodall Assemblie of Fyfe, interponit be
the Bischop of St Androis; The Breither of the said Synodall, so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
many as were present, being desyrit to remove, protestit concernyng
that actione, that the Assemblie sould proceed in forme, and
take in the appellatione with the proces, heir the alleadgeances of
the appellant and their answers, offering them readie instantly to
offer; and so accordingly to proceed and judge, utherwayes howsoever
they judgit, proceeded or sentenced in that matter, that it
should be no prejudice to their proces and sentence, nor to them,
nor to the whole Kirk of Scotland.</p>

<p>The breither, for the maist pairt, voited not to enter in the rigorous
discussing of the appellatione and proces forsaid, but to be
a midds therein, such as was proponit in wreit, and read be the
Moderator openlie unto them, qwhereof the tenor <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>If the Bischope, be his hand-wreit or personall appearance in
the Assembly, will in God’s presence deny, that ever he either
publickly professed, or meined in any sort to acclaime a supremacie,
or to be judge to uther pastors or ministers, or ever allowit the
same to have any ground in God’s word&mdash;and, if he had so done,
it had been ane error, and against his conscience and knawledge:
2. If he will deny that, in the last Synodall Assemblie, he acclaimit
to be judge thereto, and if he did that, in that he errit, and
in his superiours behaviour and contempt of the said Synodall, and
his brethren present, and craved oversicht thereof, and promisand
good behaviour in tyme to come: 3. If he will promise to clame
no farther nor he may justly be God’s word, and according to the
late conferrence, and indevore himselfe in all behalfes to schaw himselfe
in all tyme to come, ane moderat pastor, and, in so far as may
be able, ane Bischop prescryvit be Paul, and to submit his life and
doctrine to the judgement and censure of the Generall Assembly,
without any reclamatione, provocatione, or appellatione therefrom
in any tyme comeing: For his Majestie’s satisfactione, and to giue
testimonie with qwhat good will we wold obey his Heines, so far
as we might and ought, or in our conscience we may, and for the
good hope we have of his Majestie’s favourable concurrence in
building of the house of God, and for quyetness to continow in the
Kirk within this realme: And because the proces of excommunicatione
was led, and sentence pronouncit dureing the tyme of the
Conferrence, Qwhereupon his Majestie hes taken occasione of offence,
qwhilk for many good causes war convenient for to be removeit,
we will forbear to examine the said proces, or to decyde
qwhatsoever provocation or appellatione, or to call in doubt the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
legalitie of the said proces, or condemn the said Synodall; yet, for
the respects forsaids, and upon good and weightie considerationes,
we hold the said proces and sentence as unled, undecydit or
pronuncit, and repone the said Bischop in all respects so as may
concerne the said proces and sentence of excommunicatione, in the
former estate he was in immediately before the same, lykeas no
proces or sentence had been led nor deducit against him; provyding
alwayes he observe qwhat hes been promised be him in the
premisses, and behave himself dewtifully in his vocatione in all
tyme comeing.</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>Articles ordaynit be the Assemblie to be proponit and cravit
of his Majestie.</p>
</div>

<p>It will please your Majestie to take some substantive order how
the countrie may, without delay, be purgit of the pestiferous sect of
Jesuites, speciallie of such as for the friendschip in the North is
hichlie authorized; who, although they have been summoned to
underly the law, and assiste summond to that effect, yet their non-compeirance
dispensed with, they friely ganging through the countrie,
meining nothing less then to depart, and Jesuites furth of the
South and furth of France repairing of new to them.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, That seing papistry abounds in the North, be reason of the
state of qualified ministers therein, for lake of sufficient provisione
and stipends, that therefore assignationes be made unto them conformable
unto the ministrie of the South, and that the thrids there
be not assignit to the Kirks of the South, qwhill their owne Kirks
be provydit sufficiently, and such as wtherwayes hes been disponit
may be dischargit.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, That judges may be appoyntit in all schyres for executione
of the acts of Parliament, made against the breakers of the
Sabbath, adulterers, and such open transgressors of God’s law.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, That in chiefe borrows-townes, there be teaching ordinare
four tymes in the week, besyde the discipline, visitatione of the seik,
ordinare to pastors and wthers charges; that two ministers be appoyntit
to such townes.</p>

<p>5. That order be taken how the Colledge Kirks may be servit.</p>

<p>6. That order may be taken for Manses and Gleibs to ministers
makand residence at Abbay Kirks, as also such as hes or shall have
manses and gleibs, may have their necessars thereto,&mdash;such as fewall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
and pastorage, with feall and deviot, such as was wont to be of
old.</p>

<p>7. That all gifts of benefices having the cure of sawles annexit
to them, disponit be his Heines <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pleno jure</i>, and not qualified persones
presentit to them with ordinar tryall and collatione following
thereupone, may be declared, according to the king’s lawes alreadie
made, null; and that his Heines will giue new presentationes thereupon
to qualified persones, and the nullitie of the former gift to be
discussit alsweill be way of exceptione as actione.</p>

<p>8. That all presentationes or gifts of benefices of cure less nor
prelacies, disponit alsweill be his Majestie as a lawit patrone wtherwayes
then to qualified ministers, or in any extrordinary forme not
allowable to the commone law of the municipall lawes of this realme,
and forme observit in the Reformit Kirk of the same, since his Majestie’s
coronatione, may be annullit, and new presentations grantit
to qualified ministers&mdash;admitting the nullitie to be discussed, alsweill
be the way of exceptione as actione.</p>

<p>9. That all collations grantit be men that had no commissione
nor ecclesiastical functione in the Kirk, nor of that place and countrie
the tyme of the giving of the collatione, to be declarit
null, and the fruits sequestred, at the least qwhill the persones
claimand right be such collatione, be of new examined, tryed, and
admittit, if he be found worthie be them qwho shall be appoynted
to that effect, and authorized be this present Assemblie.</p>

<p>10. That the benefices of cure under prelacies, qwhereunto ministers
are admittit, may be frie from payment of the first fruits and
fyft penny, and may haue their signators of presentatione expede be
the Privy Seall, in his Majestie’s owne subscriptione only, and the
Secretars, without any payment or cautione found to the Thesaurer;
and such poor men as hes alreadie payit or found cautione, for payment
quhereof my Lord Thesaurer hes not already chairgit him in
his compts, to haue the same refundit to them, or dischargit.</p>

<p>11. Seing the default of non-depryving the unworthie, culpable,
and non-resident ministers proceeds of this, that sundrie of the
bischops hes been negligent in syndrie places; in some wther parts
there is no bischops or commissioners, and so the acts are not execute:
the Books of Modification, full of such persones as haue
never schawne themselves as ministers; That, therefore, ane commissione
be gine to ane or ma qualified persons, ministers, to sit in
Edinburgh, and call the non-residents and wthers delatit to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
worthy of depryvatione, or depryvit, qwhere there may be consultatione
of learnit men had, and the proces may be led without boast
or fear.</p>

<p>12. It is heavilie complainit be many poor men, ministers and
readers, having personages and viccarages assignit to them for their
stipends, that they are exorbitantly and ungodlie used in taxationes,
their benefice being lang syne decayed through the want of
corps-presents, wpmost cloathes, peace fies, offerands, and such lyke
things, wswallie payit in tyme of papistrie, qwhilks was the principall
rents of many personages and viccarages; and that they must
pay the extreamitie of the old taxatione according to the rate as rentalls
war then, at least without any reliefe, qwhair the most part of
the prelates exemit from preaching or service in the Kirk, gets the
haile relief of the poor feuars and vassalls, and that therefore there
may be found more equitable order of taxatione appoyntit for the
tyme to come.</p>

<p>13. That it will please his Grace to cause consider what prelacies
hes vaiked since the act of Parliament made in October 1581,
and that speciall assignatione be made for sustaining the ministers
of the Kirk belanging to them, of the readiest fruits of the same
Kirks, wtherwayes the provisione according to the act to be declairit
null.</p>

<p>14. That the Bischops, Commissioners of Argyll, and of the Isles,
may be subject to attend upon the Assemblies Generall, and to keep
their exercises and Synodall Assemblies, as in wther parts of this
realme, whilks is ane furtherance to the King’s Majestie’s obedience,
wtherwayes they appear as exeimit out of his dominione.</p>

<p>15. That his Majestie now yet give directione to some persones
of experience and good will, to searche, enquire, and try the trew
estate of the rentalls of all prelacies and wther benefices, at this present,
and in qwhaise default, and be qwhat occasione they are so
hurt and dismemberit, that thereafter the best remedies that is possible
may be considerit and provydit, for helping of them hereafter,
both for the weill of the King and the Kirk.</p>

<p>16. That his Majesty will cause the Lords of Sessione declare,
whither his Grace or the Earle of Orknay hes right to the
patronages of the benefices of Orknay and Zetland, to the effect

be participat hereof, taks God to record of the dealling of that
provinciall and this Generall Assemblie&mdash;protestit also before the
Almightie, his holy Angells, and Saints here convenit, that he hes

<h2 class="nobreak" id="FIFTY-FIRST_GENERAL_ASSEMBLY">[FIFTY-FIRST GENERAL ASSEMBLY.]</h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Generall Assembly of the Kirk, conveint at Edinburgh,
the 20th day of Junii 1587, qwhair there was assemblit the
King’s Commissioners, my Lords Chancellour and Blantyre,
with the Commissioners with the Brethrene.</p>
</div>


<p>Exhortatione made be Mr David Lyndsay. Leets, Mr Nicoll
Dalgleische, Patrick Galloway, Thomas Buchanane, and Andrew
Melvill: The said Mr Andrew, be pluralitie of votis, was chosen
Moderator, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hac vice</i>. At the said Mr Andrew his desyre, Mrs
David Lyndsay, Nicoll Dalgleische, Patrick Galloway, Paull Fraser,
Thomas Buchanan, Robert Pont, Robert Bruce, Robert Craigie,
Walter Balcanquall, Patrick Simsone, James Brysone, Peter Blackburne,
and Androw Hay, were nominat Assessors.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sessio 2.</p>

<p>Mrs David Lyndsay and John Durie, qwho were direct to my
Lord Secretar anent his Majestie’s Commissioners, reportit, That
his Heines had nominat my Lords Secretar and Justice-Clark,
qwha wald be present and concurre as their opportunitie might
serve&mdash;alwayes willing the Assembly according to his Heines
mynde, before any uther thing, be intreatit the cause of Mr John
Cowper: Nottheless, after some reasoning, was content they sould
be delayed till the morne, and that the brether qwho are on the
conferrence sould meit and reasone something concerning that
matter.</p>

<p>Anent the Books of the Assembly: Seing the King’s Majestie’s
Commissioners hes offerit their concurrence to the recovering thereof,
if it may be knowne in qwhais hands they are, The Moderator
desyrit the brether that could give any light in this matter, and
namelie Mr Patrick Gallaway, quho was direct in the last Assembly
to the King’s Majestie to sute the delyverance of the said Register,
and his Heines answer thereanent; qwho declareit his Majestie had
promised to cause them be delyverit. Thairafter it was testified be
John Braid, that at the last Assemblie, in his awne house, Mr Patrick
Adamsone, Bischop of St Androis, in presence of David Fargysone,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
confessit where the same were, and at command obtained be
the King’s Grace, he sould cause delyver the same: Lykeas it was
testified by John Durie that he heard him lykewayes grant the
having thereof: Qwhilks testificatione being considerit be the Assembly,
they concludit that charge sould be gine against him;
and for the better advyce in that matter, direct Mr David Lyndsay
to my Lord Secretar; qwho returning with his answer, thocht
meit ane supplicatione sould be gine to the Lords of Counsell to
obtaine charges against the said Mr Patrick, and lykewayes that
the Kirk sould of their awne charges and authoritie, according
qwherunto the Kirk ordaynit ane supplicatione to be pennit, and
gine to the Lords, the morne; and sicklyke ane charge to pass
from this Assembly, chargeing the said Mr Patrick to exhibite the
said booke before them, to be delyverit to the Kirk within thrie
dayes after the charge, or to schaw ane reasonable cause why; and
sicklyke to compear within the said space personallie, to answer for
his absence from this Assemblie, and to such other accusationes as
sould be layit to his charge, under the paine of the censures of the
Kirk.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sessio 3.</p>

<p>All quarters sall resorte to the Assemblie every day, at the dew
houre appoynted therto, and remaine to the end every day, under
the paine of the payment of ane groat, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">toties quoties</i>.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sessio 4.</p>

<p>It was thocht expedient, notwithstanding of the ordinance made
yesternight against Mr Patrick Adamsone, for delyvering of the
Register, That before the same be put to executione, ane humble
supplication be made to the King’s Majestie for that effect, qwhilk
the breither desyrit Mr David Lyndsay and John Duncansone to
forme.</p>

<p>Forsuameikle as there hath been ane matter of grief conceived
be the King’s Majestie againes Mrs John Cowper and James Gibsone,
movit privilie to the Moderator; It is thocht expedient be
the haill Assembly that the said cause be first privilie treattit and
considerit be the Laird of Dune, Mrs Peter Blackburne, Johne
Porterfield, Thomas Buchanane, David Lindsay, Nicoll Dalgleische,
and David Fargysone, qwham the Assembly nominat to travell,
reasone, and conferre with the saids pairties, and to sie if they can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
take up the matter be their own advyce, utherwayes to propone the
same to the full Assemblie, that the matter may be heard and reasonit
there; and to that effect, ordaynit the saids brethrene to pass
out of the Assemblie, and the saids Mrs John and James to passe
with them.</p>

<p>Seeing his Majestie is now of perfect age, and ane Parliament is
appoynted in the next moneth; It is thocht expedient that the acts
of Parliament made be oure Soveraigne Lord, his Heines’ predecessor
and Regent for the tyme, for the libertie of the trew Kirk of
God and Christ’s religione presently professit within this realme,
and for repressing of Papistrie and Idolatrie, collectit together and
craved to be confirmed; and lykewyse the executione of the
saids acts may be considerit, and what order aither excommunicatione
or law shall be desyrit against the saids Papists and Idolaters,
as also such lawes and constitutiones as are made to the derogatione
of the said libertie, or to the prejudice or stay of the course
of the Evangell, may be likewise collectit, to that effect their abrogatione
may be sought: Qwhairunto they nominat the Laird of
Dun, Mrs Robert Pont, Nicoll Dalgleische, David Lyndsay, and
Paull Fraser.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sessio 5.</p>

<p>The Commissione gine in the last Assemblie to the Presbytries
of Glasgow and Strivilling, anent Mr David Cunnynghame, concernyng
the sclander of adulterie with Elspeth Sudderland, or any
uther persone, is continued.</p>

<p>Anent the diverse and grievous complaynts of syndrie breither
against Mr Patrick Adamsone, Bischop of St Androis, at qwhais
instance he is registrat at the horne for non-payment of their stipends
assignit to them, and specially of Mrs William Strang, David
Spense, Adam Johnstoune, and uthers, of the sclander that he lyes
at the horne for not furnisching two gallons of wyne for the communione:
This matter being heavilie regraitit to the King’s Commissioners,
promise was made be the Pryor of Blantyre to communicat
the matter to the rest of the King’s Majestie’s Commissioners,
qwhais advyce for redress heirof he should report to the Assembly.
As to the regraite of some breither, that pairtly be his rebellione
and lying at the horne, pairtly be his suspensione, some divisione
ryses, that certaine resorts not to his sermones nor to the administratione
of the sacraments made be him or uther sarvice, as humiliatione&mdash;uthers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
repairs thairto&mdash;so appeares some divisione qwhilk
wad be redresst: The breither thinks meet, that, before they enter
herein, some answer be reportit to the former complaint.</p>

<p>The matter of Mrs John Cowper and James Gibsone, be the
votts of the Kirk, was committit fully to the Moderator and Assessors
to conferr, consult, advyse, and, if they may, conclude and put
finall end thereto.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sessio 6.</p>

<p>His Majestie’s Commissioners being present, thocht meit, because
Mr Patrick Adamson’s matter is civil, qwherin the King’s Majestie
hes interes, that his Grace sould be forwarnit, qwhilk the Kirk promised
to doe.</p>

<p>Anent the doubt proponit, if it be sclander to a Christiane to absent
himselfe from the sermones, ministratione of the sacraments, or
uther godlie exercises used be such as lyis at the King’s Majestie’s
horne, and are suspendit from all functione of the ministrie? The
Kirk answers, that there is no sclander in this cause, but be the
contrare, it is sclanderous to a Christiane to resort to the exercises
forsaid of such ane one as they know to be at the horne, and suspendit
from all functione of the ministrie.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sessio 7.</p>

<p>Anent the supplicatione gine in for Gilbert Lambe and certaine
in company with him presently keepit in prisone in Citde in Spaine
for the testimonie of the truth: The Assembly ordaynes the brethren
of the ministrie universallie to recommend in their prayers the
said Gilbert in particular and his companie in generall to God, and
to crave their delyverance, if it be his pleasure, or ane finall perseverance
and constancie to the end in the trew profession of the
Evangell.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sessio 8.</p>

<p>The breither of the West having admittit the Bischop of Glasgow
to the temporalitie, the Ecclesiasticall Jurisdictione being devolved
be him in the Kirk’s hand, and having receivit his obligatione
thair, in caice the Generall Assembly sould not allow of such admissione,
the same sould be undone; The haill matter being weyghit
be the full number of the breither, they universallie concludit the
said forme of admissione to be unlawfull, and ordaynit the brethren<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
admitters, to urge him performe the heids of the said obligatione,
anent the undoing and annulling of the said admissione.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sessio 9.</p>

<p>No ministers of colledges or schooles shall receave in their colledges
or schooles, any student or schollar, being of maturitie of age,
quho refuses to subscryve the trew Religione presently establisched
and professt, be the mercy of God, within this realme, or refuseing
to participat the sacraments, under the paine of the censures of the
Kirk; and farther, before any student be promovit to any degree
in the universitie, that they shall, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">toties quoties</i>, as they shall be
promovit, subscryve <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de novo</i>, utherwayes their promotiones to be
stayit, under the paine forsaid; and that the presbytries be diligent
to sie the executione of this act, as they will answer to God.</p>

<p>The Kirk within this realme hes advysit and found good, that the
Presbitries, together with the Commissioners in all the pairts of the
countrie, and every ane of them for their awne pairts, prescryve to
every young man that is minister within such ane Presbytrie, ane pairt
of Scripture, together with ane pairt of the commone places and
contravertit heads of Religione, to be diligently read, considerit,
and learnit be him, within such ane space of tyme as the Presbytrie
thinks good to appoynt him; and that his diligence may the better
appear unto the fruit thereof, at certaine tymes of the year, euery
Presbytrie being convenit, take ane count of the young man of his
trauells, be requyring of him in the pairt of scripture prescryvit to
him&mdash;first, the soume and deductione thereof in maner: 2. The
solid sence and meaning of these places qwhilk are most difficult to
be understood: 3. A collatione of the sentences qwhilk by reading
he may be able to gather out of that part of scripture; the qwhilk
arguments may either serve to confirme the truth, or else to refute
hereticall opiniones. As for the pairt of commone places and heads
of religion prescryvit unto him, let him be ready to answer to
questionyng and reasoning to the head thereupone, and so to be
exercit in this kynde, not for a tyme only, but from tyme to tyme,
qwhill he come to certaine maturitie and solidness in the scripture
of God.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sessio 11.</p>

<p>Anent the supplicatione made in name of the towne of Haddingtone,
lamenting the away-taking of their presbytrie againes the order<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
of the last platt made be the Generall Kirk: The Assemblie examining
the causes of the removeing thereof be the contrare, and finding
the occasione thereof to haue beene for lacke of obedience and
want of discipline, hes, at the earnest sute and craveing of Mrs Nicoll
Hay and John Ker, Commissioners for the said towne, restorit the
said Presbytrie, with condition and promise, that if there be not

willing us to elect Mr Robert Pont to the Bishoprick of Caithness,
vaickand be decease of umquhile Robert Earle of Marche, your
Heines’ uncle. We praise God that your Majestie hes ane good
opinione and estimatione of such a persone as we judge the said
Mr Robert to be, qwham we acknawledge indeed alreadie to be a
Bischope according to the doctrine of St Paull, and qualified to use
the functione of ane pastor and minister at the kirk of Dornoche,
or any uther Kirk within your realme, qwhan he is lawfully callit,
and worthy to have ane competent living appoyntit to him therefore;
as also to use the office of a Commissioner or Visitor in the
boundes of Caithnes, if he be burdenit therewith. But as to that
corrupt estate or office of them who hes been termit Bischops heretofore,
we find it not agreeable to the word of God, and it hes
been damnit in diverse uthers our Assemblies; naither is the said
Mr Robert willing to attempt the samen in that manner: the
qwhilk thocht good to signifie unto your Majestie, for answer unto
your Heines’ letter of nominatione, and have ordaynit our breither
to be appoyntit Commissioners to awaite upon the nixt Parliament,
to conferr with your Heines and Counsell, if neid beis, heirupone.
This, after offering our humble obedience, we earnestlie wische the
Spirit of the Lord to assist your Heines in all godlie affaires. From

<p>The Generall Assemblie of the Kirk conveint at Edinburgh,
in the New Kirk thereof, and begune the 6 of August 1588,
quhere was assemblit the Commissioners and Brethrene.</p>
</div>


<p>Exhortatione made be Mr Robert Bruce. Leitts, Mrs Robert
Pont, Thomas Buchanane, Nicoll Dalgleische, and James Robertsone:
Be pluralitie of vots the said Mr Thomas was chosen Moderator
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hac vice</i>.</p>

<p>The Kirk nominated Mrs Robert Bruce, Robert Pont, David
Lyndsay, John Robertsone, John Keith, Peter Blackburne, James
Balfoure, Robert Hepburne, John Durie, James Robertsone, James
Nicolsone, Andrew Melvill, David Fargysone, James Andersone,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span></p>


<p class="p1 center">Sessio 2.</p>

<p>It is thought expedient that, in the frequencie of this Assemblie,
the most necessar things be first handlit, concernyng the present
danger imminent to the Kirk within this realme, and to the common
weall thereof, be the arryvall of Spainʒards and Barbars; as
also the danger and decay of religione be the raritie and povertie
of ministers of the Evangell: The Kirk hes thocht for their pairt
ane dewtie in this behalfe, that ane fast be proclaimit the morne be
the ordinary teacher in the Kirk of Edinburgh, to be continowit in
the said toune the whole week.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sessio 3.</p>

<p>Forsuameikle as, universallie throughout this realme, there is
neither religione nor discipline with the poor, but the maist part
liues in filthie adulterie, incest, fornicatione, bairnes unbaptized,
and themselves never resorts to Kirks, nor participats the sacraments:
Therefore it is thought expedient that all ministers, in their
paroche kirks, shall make intimatione, and denunce to all poor
that aither be parochiners or resorte to them, having women and
bairnes, that if they report not sufficient testimoniall of their marriages,
and baptizing of their bairnes, so many as hes wyfes and
bairnes; and sicklyke, where they have participat the holy communione,
that they will be refuisit of their almes at the hands of all
good and charitable persones: exhorting also their parochiners that
they rather extend their liberality to such as be of the household of
ffayth, and having discreit judgement in giving any such persones
of their almes, that gives not evidence to them as said is.</p>

<p>Anent the citatione direct to the Moderator of the Generall Assembly
against Mr Patrick Adamsone, callit Bischop of St Androis,
makeing mentione, that forsuameikle as be ane act of the Presbytrie
of Edinburgh it was ordaynit concernyng the marriage of
George Earle of Huntlie, that his bands sould be proclaimit upon
his agrieing to subscryve to certaine articles of religione profest in
this realme, qwhilk he did subscryve; and under hope that he sould
subscryve the rest before his marriage, ane inhibition was made according
to the tenor of the said act, to diverse of the ministers, and
speciallie to the said Mr Patrick, that nane of them sould take in
hand to celebrate the said marriage, unto the tyme the said Lord
Huntlie agrie to subscryve the Confessione of the Fayth, containt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
in the acts of Parliament; with certificatione to them and every
one of them, if they failzied herein, they sould be callit for disobedience
to the voyce of the Kirk and Generall Assemblie, and punischit
therefore, as accords: Notwithstanding of the said inhibitione,
the forsaid Mr Patrick proceidit to the solemnizatione of the said
marriage, and celebrate the same upon the 21 day of July instant;
disobeying thereby the foresaid inhibitione and admonitione; as
the said citatione beares: Qwhilk being callit, and the said Mr Patrick
compearing be Mr Thomas Wilsone, his procurator, qwho
producit ane testimoniall of his sickness, subscrivit be the doctor,
Mr Robert Nicoll, and twa of his bailzies, requyring that the breither
wald not disquyit him in his sickness, they fand the said testimoniall
not to be sufficient.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sessio 5.</p>

<p>The Kirk being informit that there is a ane schip arryvit lately in
this Firth from Dunkirk, suspect to be ane spie, out of the qwhilk
ane man, as appears of some mark, is landit; they, with the Counsell
present, desyrit the provest and bailzies to man the schip, take
the men and keep them qwhill his Majestie come over; yet it is reportit
they refuise, in respect it will be ane hinderance to their traffique:
The breither thinks it meit that Mrs Robert Bruce, Andrew
Hay, and Andrew Melvill, pass to the Chancellour to let him understand
of the said answer, and offer unto his Lordship their concurrence
to request the towne.</p>

<p>Forsuameikle as in no countrie qwhere any religione is allowit,
it is permittit that the deid be buried in the kirks, and that albeit
inhibitione hes been diverse tymes made for avoyding of that abwse,
yet the acts and constitutiones of the Kirk are dayly broken: Therefore
the Kirk inhibits that any persones in tyme coming be buried
in the kirks, and that no minister give consent thereto, but directly
oppone thereto; certifying such persones as shall be the authors
and inbringers of the dead unto the saids kirks, they shall be suspendit
from the benefites of the Kirk, qwhill they make publick
repentance therefore; and the minister that giues his consent, or
discharges not his conscience in opponyng thairto, shall be suspendit
from his functione in the ministrie: And to the effect this act may
haue the better executione, supplicatione shall be made to his Majestie
that ane ordinance may pass be his Heines and Counsell discharging
the said buriall within kirks, and such lyke erecting of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
tombes, and laying of troches in kirkyards, under such paines as
his Heines and Counsell pleise to devyse.</p>

<p>Forsuameikle as sen the last act of Annexatione, his Majestie hes
transferrit the right of the patronages of diverse benefices, from his
Heines to temporall men, as Earles, Lords, Barrones, and wthers,
and hes annexit the same to their lands; of qwhom some hes gotten
confirmatione in Parliament, wthers hes obtainit the same sen the
Parliament, and the third sort hes gotten gift of the naked patronage
alanerlie, to the evident hurt of the haill Kirk: Qwherefore it is
thocht good, that his Majestie be intreatit be earnest sute, that the
saids dispositiones authorized, as said is, be Parliament, may be
brought back in the next Parliament, and such wthers as hes been
grantit sen the said Parliament, in lyke manner may be annullit:
and in the meintyme, that it may please his Majestie to close his
hands from disponing the said right of patronage, and transferring
of the same from his Majestie, qwhilk remayneth as yet undisponit;
and that his Majestie will provyde that the Commissioners and
Presbytries to qwhom the collatione of the saids benefices pertayns
be not processit or hornit for not giving admissione thereupone:
Inhibiting in the meantyme all Commissioners and Presbytries, that
they on no wayes giue collatione or admissione to any persones
presentit be said new patrones, as is above specified, unto the next
Generall Assemblie.</p>

<p>Anent the supplicatione given in be James Gibsone, desyring
that he may be hard to purge himself of the contumacie for non-compearance
in the last Assemblie, and to repone him in his awne
functione: the Kirk thought it expedient that he should declare the
cause of his non-compearance before the breither of the conferrence;
quha reportit that he declareit his conscience, the cause of his absence
was never rebellion, stubbornes, nor evill will, but only in respect
of the good affection he had to the will of the Generall Kirk,
being informed that if he had compeired, and had not bein punischit,
the matters of the Kirk wald be casten off: Qwhilk reasone being
considerit be the breither, they thought the same sufficient to purge
him of contumacie.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sessio 6.</p>

<p>Compeirit Mr Alexander Forbes, minister and persone of Fattercarden,
and in presence of the haill Assemblie, ratified ane promise
qwhilk before he made in presbytrie, that he sould sett no tacks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
nor factorie of the teynds of the said kirk, without the speciall advyce
of the Generall Kirk; declareing also in their presence that
he hes sett nane yett; and farther promising before them, that he
shall not sett in tyme comeing, nor make any right thereof to any
persone, without the consent of the Generall Assemblie.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sessio 11.</p>

<p>Mrs Robert Bruce, David Lyndsay, and John Craige, war direct
to his Majestie to understand be qwhat meines the religione
shall be maintainit within this realme, and continowit to the posteritie.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sessio 13.</p>

<p>Forsuameikle as in default of Visiting of the North pairts, qwhere
chief and greatest necessitie is, hes great inconvenience followit, albeit
no wayes in default of the breither appoyntit to that charge,
but for laick of provisione and expenses, the assignatione of their
charges being made to be payit be the Bischop of St Androis, qwha
contemptuouslie disobeys good ordour, and lyes at the horne: It is
not the lesse found expedient that the breither to qwhom commissione
was given before, shall yet undertake the burden of the commissione,
their charges and expenses being assignit to them out of
some readie payment, and that to this effect the Commissioners of
the North, viz. Mrs John Keith, Gilbert Garden, and Alexander
Rawsone, shall travell with the Lords of the Checker, and delait
the necessitie of their Visitatione, and crave the samen assignatione
to be alterit, and the commissioners’ payment mair commodiouslie
payit.</p>

<p>Anent the request of the Commissioner of Edinburgh, desyreing
the Assembly to ratifie the calling of Mr William Watsone to the
ministrie of Edinburgh: the Generall Kirk ratifies and approves the
same in presence of the said Mr William, desyrand to be transportit
from the said Kirk, qwhilk the Assemblie refused.</p>

<p>All ministers and pastors are exhortit, in their sermones to delait
openly the prejudice done to the haill Kirk be the spulzie of the
patrimonie thereof, and publicly to disallow and oppone against the
publick abusers thereof.</p>

<p>The Generall Assemblie understanding the appearing ruine and
decay of the evangell, within this realme, for fault of provisione of
ministers, and intertainment of schooles and colledges, hes thought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span>
good and convenient to give their Commissione, and be the tenor
heirof to grant full power to Mrs Robert Pont, Robert Bruce, David
Lyndsay, John Craige, Andrew Myllne, Thomas Buchanane,
Androw Hay, John Porterfield, Peter Blackburne, John Duncansone,
David Fargusone, William Strivilling, Gilbert Garden, ministers
of the Evangell, or any seven of them, to compeir before his
Majestie and Counsell, upon Monday next, or such other day as his
Majestie shall appoynt, to call, conferre, and advyse upon the said
head, and to craue humbly of his Majestie that the Ministers’ and
Readers’ assignationes may be given out at Hallowmess, and that
such as are already provydit of their stipends <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad vitam</i>, and uthers
that are content with the assignationes alreadie made to them, be
unalterit therein, qwhill they obtayne better provisione, and to that
effect to travell earnestly with his Majestie and Counsell, and to report
again answer to the next Generall Assembly of the Kirk, firme
and stable.</p>

<p>Anent the request of the Presbytrie of Dumblane, in respect of
the few number and povertie of their presbytrie, to joyne to their
Synodall Assembly the Presbytrie of Linlithgow: the Assemblie
present has found it more meit that the Presbytries of Perth and
Dunkeld shall be joynit with the Presbytrie of Dumblaine, and in
ane Synodall Assembly, to be first holden in Perth, and thereafter
in ony place qwhere the Synodall shall think it meitest.</p>

<p>The Generall Assembly hes given their commissione and authoritie
to the Presbytrie of Edinburgh, to call before them Papists and
apostats who shall happen to resort to court, or to the said towne,
and in speciall to summond my Lords Huntlie and Settowne, William
Schaw, John Chisholme, and Colonell Stewart.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sessio 14.</p>

<p>According to the allowable custome observit amongst the antients
of humiliatione and fasting of the pastors, The breither and Kirk
conveint hes thocht meit, and be ordinance statute, that in tyme
comeing, qwhen it shall please God to convene the Generall Kirk
of this realme, That the first day of the Assemblie, at the place and
towne where they conveine, ane publick fast and humiliatione be
of the haill inhabitants thereof, alswell as of the pastors conveint,
and the chair of veritie alseweell occupyit before noone in the morning
as at afternoone, be the ordinare pastors thereof; the tyme and
houres of exhortatione made before the Assemblie, being keipit as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
of before, to the effect it may please God to give his blessing to the
conventione and good ishew of their travells; and because the next
Assemblie is concludit to be in Edinburgh, the pastors thereof is
ordaynit to give intimatione heirof to the congregatione, the Sunday
before the said Assemblie.</p>

<p>Anent the questione movit, If a man, convict of adulterie three-score
years sensyne, satisfying the order of the Kirk be repentance,
and presentit new to serve in the ministrie of the Evangell, sould be
admitted thereto or not? The Assembly answers negative, and
thinks he ought not to be admittit.</p>

<p>My Lord Angus his excommunicatione reducit be reasone of informalitie;
and because there is sufficient cause of such censure
against my Lord in the said sentence, if the proces had been formally
led, Therefore the Kirk hes instantly desyrit his Lordship to
remove the cause; and to that effect maist diligently caire that the
Sabbath be not violat be ffaires or mercats within his owne bounds&mdash;that
no labouring nor carriage be wsit within the same, and that
his vassalls compell not their tennents to wse carriage on the Sabbath,
and likewise to travell with them, that they give some day of
the week to their tennents, as to schear and lead their cornes, that
they be not abstractit from the kirk on the Sabbath; Qwhaise answer
was, that with all diligence he could, he sould travell to that
effect, and at the rysing of the Lords, sould ryde home himself to
Douglass, and hold a court, and make lawes and penaltie for restraining
ane violation of the Sabbath.</p>

<p>My Lord Somerwell being present, alleadgit the priviledge
of his infeftment for holding the mercatt of Carnwath on the Sabbath;
notwithstanding he condescendit that no marcat nor ffair
sould be keepit their on the Sabbath; and in caise of his failzie, the
presbytrie there was commandit to proceed against him according
to the act of the Kirk.</p>

<p>Anent the lament made be the brethrene of the manifold kynds
of violatione and profanatione of the Lord’s day, be ganging of
milnes, saltpannes, schearing and leading of cornes, carying of victuall
to and from burrowstounes; The Assemblie, as of before, declares
the same to be unlawfull, against the law of God and acts of
Parliament, and ordaynes the violators thereof to be punisched conforme
to the ordinance made of before&mdash;discharging the burrowstownes
from the receaving of loads and carriages brought to them
on the Sabbath day. Ordaynes the presbytries to travell with the
gentlemen within their bounds, to grant some week day unto their
tenants to that effect.</p>

<p>And farder, for better observatione of the Sabbath, ordaynes the
haill pastores here present to give in a Roll of the names of the
persons quhilks may best stopp the mercats within their bounds;
to the effect his Majestie may be requestit to interpone his authority,

benefice bot such as shall interdyte himself either to the provinciall
Assemblie of Angus and Meirnes, or then to the Presbytrie, qwhilk

<p>Forsuameikle as it is certaine that the word of God cannot be

comptable and subject to the censure of the judgement of the presbytrie,
qwhom frae he receavit the same; and that all presentationes
be direct in tymes comeing to the presbytries qwhere the benefice
lyis; alwayes in admissione or deprivatione of Ministers in Buchane,
Aberdeene, Garrioche, and Marre, that Aberdeen and Buchane proceed

<p>Anent the supplicatione given in be James Hering, desyring the

consent to the marriage of Agnes Blair his daughter, and if he had
not cause of refuseall, to giue command to the minister of the paroche

<p>Forsuameikle as it is considerit that the patrimonie of the Kirk
hes bein waistit be such as are clad with benefices, qwhilk is the
occasione of laike of provisione to the ministrie; Therefore, all

<p>Having now completed the Register of another epoch in the history of the
Reformed Church of Scotland, which embraces the first thirty-two years
of its existence,&mdash;exhibiting in its internal movements the equivocal and
conflicting elements of a new establishment, and blending in its structure
the incongruous peculiarities both of Episcopacy and Presbytery;
we have now reached that period in its progress when it assumed a
more precise and clearly defined position, as a purely Presbyterian
Church. On the 5th of June 1592, immediately after the close of the
General Assembly, of which the proceedings have just been given, the
<span class="smcap">Magna Charta</span> of the Church of Scotland was obtained in an act of
Parliament “for abolisching of the actis contrair the trew Religion.”
It is therefore deemed suitable to pause in the transcript of the Ecclesiastical
proceedings, and to subjoin, in an Appendix, the several statutes
of the Civil Legislature applicable to the period intervening betwixt
1567, when the Church was first fully established, and 1592,
when the distinct character of Presbyterianism was stamped upon it
by the Law of the Land. These statutes, accordingly, are now subjoined
in chronological order&mdash;reserving for a future occasion any less
important and authoritative documents connected with our subject.</p>

<p>Since the Preface to these sheets was in types, and, indeed, after
it was made up for the press, the Editor has been favoured with the
subjoined Letter from Dr Lee, in reply to some inquiries with regard
to the measures adopted for recovery of the ancient Records
of the Church. It would have been embodied in the Preface had
it reached in time; but the Editor avails himself of this opportunity
to do justice to all the parties who have taken an interest in the
matter of our ancient Records, and seconded Dr Lee’s most meritorious
exertions.</p>

<p class="p1 right">“<em>March 19, 1839.</em></p>

<p class="noindent smcap">“My Dear Sir,</p>

<p><span class="pad3">“I am sorry</span> that neither my health nor my leisure allows
me to detail any of the proceedings with a view to the recovery of
the Records of the Church. From the year 1820 to 1830, the correspondence
on the subject with the late and the present Bishop of
London, continued at frequent intervals, and I took repeated journies
to London for the purpose of carrying the point. Messrs Spottiswood
and Robertson were very active in the matter. I had many
interviews with several members of the Government and Legislature,
and, in particular, I was greatly indebted to the Earl of Haddington,
Sir William Rae, and Mr Home Drummond. The Dean
of Faculty (then Solicitor-General) took a great interest in the
matter, and I ascribe it very much to his influence, combined with
the very hearty and vigorous exertions of Sir William Rae, that Sir
Robert Peel, when Secretary for the Home Department, interposed
in 1829.</p>

<p>“There had been Petitions to Parliament&mdash;That to the House of
Lords was presented by Lord Haddington, and supported by Lord
Melville. The Petition to the House of Commons was presented
by the Lord Advocate, (Sir Wm. Rae,) and supported by Sir James<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380"></a>[380]</span>
Mackintosh and many other Members. The effect of these movements,
and especially of a letter from the Secretary of State to the
President of Sion College, was to prevail on them to go the length,
in 1830 or 1831, (I have not the precise date in my recollection,)
of resolving to consent to a full transcript from these Records being
taken, at the expense of the Church of Scotland. Unhappily this
resolution was not communicated to me till the time of the meeting
of the Patronage Committee in 1834; and a majority of that Committee,
when they ordered the Books before them, resolved to retain
them.</p>

<p>“It is needless now to reflect on what was done. The object of
this resolution was to serve the Church; but some oversight was
committed, through which the Books were left in very unsafe keeping,
and so they perished irrecoverably. It is still possible that the
Duplicate, which was presented to the Assembly 1638, may exist.
It consisted of more volumes, and was more truly the Register than
that which was in Sion College. But where it can be is not so
easily conjectured. I really think it very probable that it is still in
existence.&mdash;In haste,</p>

<p>The Articles proponit in his Majestie’s name to the Generall

<p>His Majestie declares, that in respect he cannot of honour sie

to sie the last act of Parliament keepit concernyng the conveining
of the Generall Assemblie be his Majestie’s appoyntment; willing
them heirfore, before their skailling, to direct two or three of their
number unto him, to desyre him to appoynt the day and place of
their next conveining.</p>

<p>Secondlie, His Majestie desyres them to make ane Act of their
Assemblie, prohibiting all and euery ane of the ministrie, under
the paine of deprivatione, to declame againes his Majestie or Counsellors’
proceedings in pulpit, not only in respect of his Majestie’s
knawne good intention, for the furthsetting of pietie and justice,
but lykewayes because his Majestie at all tymes giues readie accesse
and loving care to sundrie of the ministers, to informe, delait, or
complaine, either in their awn name or in the name of any of the
brethrene.</p>

fyve or six of the most discriet of the ministers, that his Majestie

desyres, that through all the Presbytries of this countrie,
there shall be some appoyntit to advertise and informe his Majestie
heirafter, with diligence, for the mair speedie remedie, not only of
qwhatsumever practises they can learne many wayes, of Papists
and Spanish factiones, but also of the receipters and practises of
Bothwell, qwhereof they can haue any knawledge; Qwhais haill
courses, as they are directly against his Majestie’s persone, so
whollie they tend to the subversione of the whole religione: with
direction also to them to informe also the haill Barrones and honest
men maist tenderous of his Majestie’s wellfare to gine ever such
faithfull intelligence of the saids practises as they can learne from
tyme to tyme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386"></a>[386]</span></p>

<p>Fifthly, His Majestie desyres, that through all the countrie,
qwhere there is any ports for landing-places, that there be some of
the brethren speciallie appoyntit to deall so with the burgesses that
they may take good and sufficient tryall according to his Majestie’s
law made thereanent, of all those qwho shall hereafter come in, or
pass furth of this countrey qwharfra they came, and qwharto they
are bound; qwhat is their traffique or intention to doe: And so,
after good and sufficient tryell, if there be anything of weight and
importance, that they on no wayes faill to make his Majestie acquaint
therwithall; to the effect his Majestie may the more easilie
discover qwuhatsumever forraigne or civill practises, is or shall be
in heid against the present estate of religione: And this he cravit
to be done so faithfullie, as he hes good opinione of your earnest
affectione, no lesse in the preservation of his Majestie’s awne persone
as in the defence of the common cause; as also he promises to
assist and aide yow in all and qwhatsumever your good resolutiones,
that may tend to the furderance of peace and quyetness; with the
advancement and maintainance of the religion presently professit in
this realme.</p>

<p class="p1">The Generall Assembly of the Kirk giues commissione to their
brethren, Mrs Patrick Galloway, his Hienes’ minister, Peter Blackburne,
and Patrick Simpsone, to give informatione to his Majestie
of the evident danger imminent to the Kirk of God, within this
realme, according to the instruction giuen unto them, and there withall
to present to his Majestie, the humble Articles and Petitions of
the Assemblie proponit for removeing of the saids dangers, and to
insist with all humilitie and dew reverence for his Majestie’s good
answer thereto, to the glory of God, and the comfort of his Kirk,
and to report with all good diligence, his Majestie’s answer to the
Assembly before they dissolve.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Dangers qwhilks through the impunitie of the excommunicat
Papists, traffiquers with the Spainʒards and wthers
enemies of the Religione and Estate are imminent to the
trew Religione professit within this countrie, his Majestie’s
person, crown, and libertie of this our native countrey.</p>
</div>

<p>The samyn dangers, whilk of before by the craftie and pernicious
practices of the Jesuites, and malicious, unnaturall, and treasonable
conspiracies of the Earles of Huntlie, Erroll, and Angus,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398"></a>[398]</span>
with their complices, threatins the subversione of the trew religione
and the professors thereof, his Majestie’s crowne and persone, and
of this their native countrie to the cruell and merciless Spainʒard,
and were at that tyme discovered and apprehended be his Majestie
and Estates, and haill bodie of this realme, so evidentlie that nane
can pretend ignorance&mdash;at this tyme are imminent, more urgent and
maire to be feared nor qwhen the danger seemed to be greatest, as
may appear by these reasons <span class="nowrap">following:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><em>First</em>, It is certaine that the Spainʒard qwho, with so great preparationes
in the lxxx. and aught year interprized the conquess of
this isle, remaines as yet firme of that intentione, and waits only on
ane meit occasione to accomplische that his purpose, as it appeares
clearly by his continowing in this intertainment of intelligence, and
trafficting with the forsaids excommunicats, ever since the dissipation
of his navie.</p>

<p><em>Secundo</em>, The manifest rebellions of the forsaids excommunicats
and defections from his Majestie’s obedience, after so evident
appearances of their wrack for their manifest treasonable attempts
at the Bridge of Die, at Falkland, &amp;c. and the proofe of his Majestie’s
obedience and favour toward them in pardoning their forsaids
treasones, declares that their malicious and restless ingynes in the
prosecuting of their unnaturall conspiracies against the religion and
countrie, cannot leave off nor cease so long as they are not punischit,
nor restrainit by justice and execution of justice.</p>

<p><em>Thirdlie</em>, Qwhereas the Kirk, on all occasions, hes insistit to declair
to his Majestie, Counsell and Estates, the dangers evident for
the tyme, and to craue convenient remedies thereunto, yet in effect
nothing hes been obteinit, notwithstanding whatsumever promises,
acts, proclamations, reads, &amp;c. Qwhairthrow they have bein alwayes
put in great securitie, and taks libertie and boldness of farther
practises and attempts.</p>

<p><em>Fourthlie</em>, Notwithstanding it was expressly provydit be act of
Counsell, that nane should presume to traffique nor speak in favours
of the saids excommunicats, under the payne of tynsell of their
offices; yet now they are advancit in greater credite of his Majestie
that are knowne to have been their chiefest favourers, and they ceise
not as yet, contrare to their promises, to procure them all favour,
sicht and immunitie, as it appeares in the effect, qwhatsoever they
pretend.</p>

<p><em>Fifthlie</em>, The erection of the idolatrie of the Masse in diverse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399"></a>[399]</span>
quarters of the land, as, namely, in Mr Walter Lyndsay’s house of
Balgay, in Angus&mdash;in the young Laird of Bonnytonne’s house
Barnes&mdash;in the Earle of Angus’ houses of Bothwell and Clidesdaill,
and in the places of his residence in Douglasdaill&mdash;in the Earle of
Huntlie’s house of Strabogy and Auld Aberdeene&mdash;in the Earle of
Arroll’s houses of Logyamont and Slaines,&mdash;proves clearly that either
they finde themselves sufficiently assurit of such favour and assistance
within the countrey, as may plainly mentaine their cause be
force, or else that they are persuaded of the aide of strangers, to be
in such readiness as in dew time may serve for their reliefe, before
that his Majestie and professors of religion performe any thing in
effect in the contrair, or wtherwayes they durst never so openly disclose
their idolatrie.</p>

<p><em>Sixthlie</em>, The refuseing the act of abolitione offerit to them be
his Majestie, to the great griefe of his subjects, proveth sufficiently
the samen; for it is very probable and manifest that they wald never
have refused so great ane benefite, except they had thought themselves
fullie assured of ane better, either be favour of Court and assistance
within the countrey, or be concurrance had of strangers
without.</p>

<p><em>Seventhlie</em>, Their refuseall to entir in ward, notwithstanding of
his Majestie’s indignatione, and all that might follow therupon,
proves the same.</p>

<p><em>Auchtlie</em>, The late arrival of this bark at Montross, evidently
shawis that their dangerous practises are presently at the poynt of
executione against the religion and the countrie, and must hastily
bring forth some great inconvenient, except they be preventit and
resisted be ane present remedie.</p>

<p><em>Ninthlie</em>, The open conventions of the foirenamit excommunicat
Earles halden at Brechine and uthers places, since the arryvall of
the said bark, declares that they esteem their courses now to be so
substantiallie led, that they regard not qwhat may be done for resisting
of the same.</p>

<p><em>Tenthlie</em>, The diligence of the saids excommunicats in prepareing
and putting of their haill forces in the north in armes and readiness
upon advertisement, schawes that they have some present
enterpryze, and attends only upon concurrance qwhilk appearandly
they are very meikle animat to look for since the arryvall of the
said bark.</p>

<p><em>Eleventhlie</em>, Qwhereas his Majestie and Estates, at the first discovery<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400"></a>[400]</span>
of their conspiracies, apprehendit ane very great danger to
trew religione, the King’s Estate and Crowne and libertie of the
countrie; and notwithstanding that the samen cause of danger as
yet remaines haill unremovit, there is no apprehension of any danger,
nor any care to withstand it. It is evident that either there is
ane inclinatione and purpose to cover, extenuat and beir furth the
evill cause, qwherthrow they will not sie, or else the Lord in judgement
hes blinded and hardened the heartes of all Estates, to graape
in the mid-day that qwhilk they cannot sie, qwhilk is the greatest
danger of all, and ane most certaine argument of the wrath of God,
and his heavie judgement hingand over the land, and so meikle the
maire to be fearit because there is no cause of fear to be apprehendit.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Remedies for the samine.</p>

<p>For remedie of the forsaids dangers, the Assembly ordaynes the
Commissioners to deall earnestlie with his Majesty, that he may
apprehend the perrill, and be movit with ane bent affectione, to
proceed against the foirenamit excommunicat Papists, Traitors, as
<span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. That the saids excommunicats be forfaultit without favour;
and, to that effect, that the Parliament appoyntit to be the 27th of
this instant be halden precisely without any kind of delay&mdash;the
Advocat sufficientlie instructit in every poynt, that the summonds
may be found relevant, and sufficient probatione provydit.</p>

<p>2. That nane suspect of Religione be chosen upon the Articles.</p>

<p>3. That they be persewit after the forfatrie be way of deid, with
all extreamitie, and their land and rents annexit to the Crowne,
to remaine with his Majestie and successors for ever, and no pairt
thereof disponit to any in favoures of the persones forfaultit.</p>

<p>4. That in the meantyme his Majestie his guard be imployit for
apprehending Mr Walter Lyndsay, the Abbot of New Abbay,
Bonnytoune, younger, Mr George Kerr, Mr Alexander Leslie,
Thomas Tyrie, with all uthers traffiquers with Jesuites and Seminarie
Priests, not conteint in the summonds of forfatrie.</p>

<p>5. That the rebells’ houses be taken, chargit and mannit, and
their livings intromittit with and uptaken to his Majestie’s use
without favour, and no pairt thereof disponit to their friends, or any
uther persone for their commoditie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401"></a>[401]</span></p>

<p>6. That all persones be inhibite, under the paine of treasone and
tynsell of their life, lands and goods, to receipt, supply, ryse and
concurre, or have intelligence with the forsaids excommunicats,
under qwhatsomever pretence of vassalls or defenders.</p>

<p>7. That the haill subjects be chargit to put themselves in armes
be all good meanes they can, remaining in full readiness to persew
and defend, as they shall be certified be his Majestie or uthers finding
the occasion urgent.</p>

<p>8. That the bark arryvit at Montrose be apprehended, and the
persones that were within her, together with such others as hes had
a dealing with them, according as they shall be given up in ticket,
be callit and diligently examinat for discoverie of the practises and
purposes qwhilk they have presently in hand.</p>

<p>9. Forsuameikle as the Lord Hoome hes contraveint sundrie
poynts qwherin he was oblisched to the Kirk of Edinburgh be his
promise at the receiving of his subscriptione, as, namely, in not satisfying
the Assembly of Fyfe, and not receaving ane minister in
his house&mdash;in not removeing furth of his company Captaine Androw
Gray and Thomas Tyrie; whereby, as also by his sclanderous lyfe
sen his subscriptione, he hes given just cause of suspition to the
Kirk and all good men, that in his heart he is not yet trewlie sanctified
and convertit to the trew Religione: Therefore, that his Majestie
wald take earnest tryall of the premisses, and thereof judge if
there appear in him such ane sinceritie of religion and lyfe as his
Majestie may lippen to, and the Kirk look for sure friendschip in
such dangerous a tyme, in the cause of religione; qwhilk not being
found, that his Majestie wald remove him from his company, and
discharge him of all publick office and commandment.</p>

<p>10. That the guard presently taken up be tryit, together with
their Captaines, in respect of many complaynts given against them
to the Assemblie.</p>

<p>Anent the supplication of the minister and parochiners of Bruntisland,
desyrand the Assembly to allow the act of the Synodall Assembly
of Fyfe concerning their new kirk, in allowing thereof to
be the paroche kirk: The haill Kirk present being advysit with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403"></a>[403]</span>

mair convenient nor the ald kirk, qwhilk is not able to receave the

<p>Alexander Lord Hoome compearand in face of the Assemblie; and
inquyrit be the Moderator, if he confest in heart before the Lord,
and with his mouth, that he was justly casten out of the Kirk be a
sentence of excommunication pronuncit against him be the Synodall
Assemblie of Fyfe, and as he wald answer upon paine of his
salvation and damnatione, simply to speak the truth,&mdash;protestit and
acknowledged openly, that he was justly excommunicat, and confessit
his fault therein: And being inquyrit why he soucht to be relaxit
from the said sentence according to the direction of the presbytrie
of Edinburgh, excusit him be ignorance of that part of the act. As
also being accusit that he deteaned the stipends of sundrie of the
ministrie, speciallie of Chirnsyde&mdash;answerit, he was ready to doe
what he ought to doe of law. Being further demandit why he hes
not keepit conditions, specially sett doune in the act of the presbytrie
of Edinburgh&mdash;as, namely, touching ane minister in his awne
house&mdash;touching the removing of Thomas Tyrie out of his house:
yet, in that poynt, he is content to haue ane, as the Kirk shall appoint
him; and as to Thomas Tyrie, grants he was in his service
sen his subscryving, but understood not that he was obliged to remove
him qwhill the Kirk had proceeded to excommunicatione
againes him, qwhilk he believes they granted it: alwayes fra the
said Thomas was excommunicat, he removed him out of his companie;
and as to John Tyrie and Captaine Gray, they are not his
servants. Being requyrit if there was any persone callit Cowie,
with whom he spacke schortlie, or any sett on land with the bark
that came last in? Denyes the samen. And inquyrit if M‘Qwhirrie
was in his house shortly? Grants that, within these few dayes
he was in his house, and came by his witting, having neither letter
nor commissione to him, and past away within halfe an hour.
And last of all, the said Lord confessit in presence of God and his
holy angells, whom he took witnesses, and the Lord Jesus whom he
tooke judge, when he shall come to judge the quick and the dead,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404"></a>[404]</span>
that he profest from his heart the trew religion presently professt be
this Kirk here present, whereof he hes already subscrivit the articles
before the presbytrie of Edinburgh, and with his solemn oath
confessit before them, and now confesses before the Assemblie, to be
the only trew and infallible religion qwhilk leads to salvatione,
qwherein he mynds to liue and die, and shall to the uttermost defend
againes all the enemies thereof; and denyes, as he shall answer
to the dreadfull God, the Romane Catholick religione, all the Antichristian
religion directlie opponit to the truth of God and his
trew service, qwhilk he testifies to the haill Assembly be upholding
of his hand, and with solemne witnessing of God, that he hes no

<p>Anent the matter of offence conceavit be his Majestie against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409"></a>[409]</span>
John Rosse, minister, be occasione of ane sermone made be him in
presence of the Provinciall Assembly of Perth: The said matter
being first ordaynit to be weyit and treatit in private conferrence,
and ane certain number of the grave, learnit, and godlie breither
being appoyntit therto, and to give their judgment to the whole
Assembly, the said breither reportit their advyce and proceedings
in wryte, as follows:</p>

<p>First, They have found that the people departed not out of the
Kirk before the end of the doctrine, as it hes been reportit to his
Majestie, qwherthrow he might have uttered any kynd of offence,
and that the said Assemblie had pronuncit no damnator sentence
against him, but that they only admonisched upon such causes and
considerations as after follows:</p>

<p>1. That he delyverit that doctrine at that tyme when his Majestie’s
rebells and enemies were assembled on the fields, qwhairthrough
it might appeare to the people that the Kirk allowit Bothwell’s
treasonable attempts, and that the Assembly of purpose had
placed him in that rowme to alienat the hearts of his people from
his Majestie’s obedience.</p>

<p>2. In respect of certaine speeches delyverit be him without any
sufficient warrand, so far as they could see and understand, and
namely that sentence pronuncit against the House of Guise <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de
futuro</i>.</p>

<p>3. In respect of the hard delyverie of speeches spoken of his
Majestie, and qwhilk might have been thought to have cravit
greater years and farther experience; ffarther, the haill breither,
bayth of the Conferrence and of the Provinciall of Perth, all in ane
voyce acknawledges that there is just cause of ane sharper rebuke
and threatning of heavier judgments furth of the grunds of that
text, then hes been or might be utterit be him; and whatsoever he
utterit, as he deponit before God and upon his conscience, he
utterit of love, seeking alwayes his Majestie’s standing, on na preoccupied
minde, prejudgit opinione, or troublit affection, but of ane
saul, thristing and seeking alwayes his Majestie’s honour and weill
in God; and therefore approves his haill doctrine in that poynt, as
it hes beine read and declarit be himself, in such heids as semit to
be most offensive; and as concernyng the admonitione of the provinciall
of Perth, and the causes moving them thereunto, the brethren
reverences and allowis the judgement in all things, upon consideration
as is before exprest; only anent the sentence touching<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410"></a>[410]</span>
the House of Gwise <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de futuro</i>, because the haill brethren heard it
not, and he himself professes he remembers not he spake swa, naither
had he such meining at any tyme, and confest his fault if such ane
word hes fallen out&mdash;the Brethren thinks with himself in that poynt
that if he hes spoken, so he hes faillit, having no just warrand: and
being mynded to satisfie his Majestie allwayes so far as possible
may be done with ane good conscience, after earnest incalling of
the name of God for assistance of his Holy Spirit and long advysement,
hes found it good that the admonition of the provinciall of
Perth, as said is, be reverencit of the said haill Generall Assemblie,
and that the Assemblie at this tyme giue farther to the said John
Ross, ane grave and earnest admonitione to speak at all tymes reverently
and with such wisdome of his Majestie, as he alwayes may
have so clear ane warrant of his speeches as may fully satisfy his
own conscience before God, and have the approbatione and allowance
of all his godly brethren; and that this admonitione be extendit
to all uthers young men of the ministrie and to the haill Assemblie.
Qwhilk judgement of the said brethren being weell considerit be
the haill Assemblie, after good deliberatione, votit to the approbatione
of their said judgement, and allowit be the samen in all poynts.
And thereafter the said John Rose being callit in, he, in presence
of the haill Assemblie, protestit before God and in his conscience,
that qwhatsoever he utterit in the doctrine delyverit be him, he utterit
the same for love to his Majestie’s weill and standing, of no
preoccupied minde, prejudgit opinione, or troublit affectione, but of
ane saul seikand his Majestie’s honour and weill in the land, havand
neither eye nor respect to his Majestie’s traitors being then in
armes upon the fields; yet granting some words hardly delyverit
(though trewly): and as concernyng the words spoken of the House
of Gwise <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de futuro</i>, as is alleadgit, before the Lord, remembers not
he spake such words, neither had intention nor meaning to speak
the samen, and if he spake the samen, it was ane fault of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">elapsus
linguæ</i>.</p>

<p>The Moderator, at command of the said Assemblie, in the name
and fear of God, admonished the said brother, and all uther young
men of the ministrie and haill Assemblie, in all tyme comeing, to
speak so reverently and discreetly of his Majestie in all tyme comming,
that they may have so clear warrand of their speeches as may
fully satisfy their own conscience before God, and have approbatione
and allowance of all the godly, and his Majestie have no just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411"></a>[411]</span>

the said John with all humilitie reverenced.</p>

to the Assemblie, that the Kirk wald take care to appoynt
some qualified men for the ministrie there, for qwhois provisione

<p>Concerning the defectiones of the ministrie: The samen at length

<p class="p1 center">Corruptiones in the office.</p>

<p>Forsuameikle as be the too sudden admission and light tryall of
persones to the ministrie, it cometh to passe, that many sclanders
fall out in the persones of ministers, It wald be ordaynit in tyme
comeing that mair diligent inquisition and tryall be used of all such
persones as shall enter in the ministrie, as speciallie in thir poynts:
that the intrant shall be posed upon his conscience before the great
God, (and that in most grave manner,) qwhat moves him to accept
the office and charge of the ministrie upon him; that it be inquyrit
if any by solicitatione or moyen, directlie or indirectlie, prease to
entir in the said office, and it being found, that the solister be repellit,
and that the Presbytrie repell all such of their number from
voting in the election or admissione as shall be found moyeners for

to that effect.</p>

the ministrie and upon congregationes, that utters thereafter that
they were not callit be God, It wald be provydit that nane sould

consciences, and sick uthers, qwherin the pastorall charge is most
kythit, and that he be meit to stop the mouthes of the adversaries;
and such as are not found qualified in thir poynts to be delayed to
further tryall, and whill they be found qualifyed. And because
men may be found meit for some places qwhilk are not meit for
uthers, it wald be considerit that the principall places of the realme
be provydit with men of most worthie gifts, wisdom, and experience,
and that nane take charge of greater number of people nor they
are able to discharge, and the Assemblie to take order heirwith, and
the act of the Provinciall Assembly of Lowthiane made at Linlithgow
to be uregit.</p>

<p>That such as shall be found not given to their book and studie of
Scriptures&mdash;not carefull to have bookes&mdash;not given to sanctification
and prayer&mdash;that study not to be powerfull and spirituall&mdash;not applying

zeall&mdash;negligent in visiting the sick, caring for the poor, or indiscriet
in chooseing of the word not mietist for the flock&mdash;flatterers
and dissembling at publick sinnes, and speciallie of great personages
in their congregationes, for flatterie or for fear; that all such
persones be censured according to the degrees of their faults, and
continuing thereinto, be depryvit; That such as be slothfull in the
ministratione of the sacraments and irreverent&mdash;as profaners, receaving
clean and unclean, ignorants and sencless&mdash;profane and
making no conscience of their professione in their calling and families&mdash;omitting
dew tryall or wsing nane or light tryall&mdash;having respect

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Imprimis</i>: Ye shall schaw to the said Assemblie our good will to
have all the kirks of Scotland planted with ministers, and sufficient
livings appoyntit unto them to the great hurt of our owne
rent, and that portion of the thirds qwhilk was assignit to our
house and our comptrollers in the possession thereof: But finding
that the haill thrids is not sufficient to plant the haill kirks; nor yet
commodious to ministers to serve in ane place, and have their livings
to sick in ane wther, very far distant from their cure, Therefore,
we thought good to set fordward ane order for locall stipends,
foundit upon the ground that all the kirks of Scotland should have
ministers, and all ministers stipends within their awne paroches, of
sic natour, as be our authoritie on the ane part, and concurrence
and procurement of the Kirk on the wther, might be obtainit from
the tacksmen of lands, present possessors of the said rent; for the
qwhilk effect, we causit ane act of Parliament to be made in the
year of God 1592, grantand commission to certaine Noblemen,
Counsellors, Officers, and Ministers, and the wther parts, to intreate
and presente this matter, and alse hes given command
in particular, to certain of our Lords of Chekker to help with
their advyce and labours to bring the matter to some perfectione,
qwherein, as we understand, there is something done, as ane
part of the brethren can bear record. Lykeas we continow in our
good mynde, in our tyme to have the kirks sattled anent their livings,
and not intanglit yearly with proces, and our haill kirks
planted within this realme, be thir presents, offers, and permitts, to
the said Assembly, to cause our Commissioners, Counsellers, Officers,
to conveen presently, before the expiring of this Assemblie,
with the said Commissioners for the Kirk, to begin this good purpose,
and to lay the ground, and to sett downe the order, and tyme,
and place of convening, to prosecute the samen to the finall end,
conforme to the act of Parliament, so that the stay, if any shall be

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431"></a>[431]</span></p>

<p><em>Item</em>, Ye shall schaw to them that is ane stay to this good
worke, that be some of their preachings they wald make the people
to understand that we and our Counsell wald stay the planting
of the kirks, and take away the present livings possessit be
ministers, albeit the contrair be of veritie, and that we and our
counsell is most willing that the haill kirks be plantit, and the
rents of the ministers to be augmentit so far as lawfully may be obtainit,
with consent of our nobilitie and others tacksmen of teynds,
qwhais rights, but order of law, we cannot impare; and therefore
this forme of preaching discourages our good counsellors maist
willing in this wark, and is ane heavie sclander to the ministers
themselves, qwherin ye shall desyre order to be taine, that the lyke
be not in tyme coming.</p>

of our good will, and also that answers be given, in particular, be
ane generall voteing of the haill Assemblie, and no wayes to be referrit

<p>Forsuameikle as the brethren of the ministrie conveint in the Generall
Assemblie hes with ane solemne humiliatione acknowledgit
their sinnes this day, and negligence in their conscience before God,
and hes interit in ane new covenant in their charges, and seeing ane
great part of the ministrie is not present at this actione; Therefore
the Kirk commands their brethren of the Synodall Assemblies to
make the lyke solemne humiliatione and protestatione as was observit
be the Generall, at their next convening, and so many as beis
not at their Synodall, to doe it at their presbytries.</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>Articles proponit be the Commissioners of the constant Platt
to be advysit and passit in Acts be the Generall Assembly.</p>
</div>

<p><em>First</em>, It is thought requisite be the saids Commissioners, and
cravit, that the said Assembly would ordayne that the Moderators
of ilk presbytrie within this countrie sould give presentations <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jure
devoluto</i>, of all benefices of cure, belonging to laick patrones within<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_432"></a>[432]</span>
their bounds, that hes not presented qualifiet persones within
sax monethes after the decease of the last possessor thereof; and
sicklyke, the benefices qwhilks shall vaike hereafter in caice the saids
patrones neglect to present within sax moneths, to ministers serving,
or that shall serve the cure of the saids kirks, under the paine
of deprivatione; and that the saids ministers accept their presentationes,
and persew them: And in caice there be not actuall ministers
presently at the saids kirks, in that caice, that the saids Moderators
deall effectuallie with wthers qualified persones, to accept the
saids presentatations, and to prosecute the samen be law.</p>

<p>That all beneficit persones that are here present in this Assemblie
be movit presently to interdyte themselves from all setting and
disponyng any part of their benefices to qwhatsomever persone or
persones, without the speciall consent and allowance of the Generall
Assemblie, and the interdictione to be subscryvit be such as are
present, and wthers that are absent urgit be their presbytries to doe
the lyke, immediately after the dissolving of the Assembly.</p>

<p>Because the kirks in diverse places of the countrey sustaines
great hurt through the laike of unqualified persones in the ministrie
instructed and trained up in the schooles of theologie; therefore
it is cravit that ane act be made in this Assemblie, ordayning every
provinciall Assemblie to furnische a sufficient entertainment for a
bursse in the New Colledge of St Andrews, this 96th year, and so
forth, yearly, in all tyme coming; and that every Provinciall Assemblie
shall have the priviledge to present the said bursar so oft
as the benefice or place shall vaike: and in caice there be any of
the ministers’ sones within the province, of meit graces for the said
place, that he be preferrit to all wthers to the ministrie; and after
the expyreing of his course, in the study of theologie, that he be
bound to imploy his travells within the province to the qwhilk his
graces may be answerable&mdash;and that it be not leisum to the said
bursar to imploy his travells in any wther place, except be the consent
and advyce of the said province.</p>

<p>Seeing the necessitie of the common affaires of the Kirk craves, that
there be a continuall travelling and attendance at court both for the
farderance of the present work qwhilk is in hands, anent the planting
of the Kirks, as lykewayes of the continuall diligence of the
enemie, waiting at all occasiones, speciallie qwhen they finde any
slackness upon the part of the Kirk, in the discoverie and resisting
of the interprizes of the said enemie; Therefore it is cravit, that ane<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_433"></a>[433]</span>
care and burden of the common cause be laid upon some brethrene
be the Generall Assemblie, either of them that are residents here
about court, or else of some others to be appoyntit of diverse partes
of the countrie, because, wtherwayes, there is nane that finds themselves
in conscience bound to haue any care heirof, or to make
panes therein.</p>

<p>The first two articles the Assemblie answerit is agreit: To the
third, the Assemblie ordaynes it to be movit in the provinces first:
To the fourth, Appoynts Mrs Robert Bruce, David Lyndsay,

the word at table, and reverent saying of the grace before and after

<p>His Majestie is blottit with banning and swearing, qwhilk is too

<p>His Majestie wold labour to have such companie about him as
himself, according to his awne <span class="transnote nowrap">{blank space}</span> qwhilk is gravely to be

<p>In respect of the Report of the brethren of the north, that gentlemen
and burgesses are lyke to leave their houses for fear of the
enemies, seeing their great insolence unrepressed at hame, returning
of their wyves to the countrie againe, and their provisions in
their houses and castles for their hame-coming, qwhilk is murmurit
against in all the countrie:</p>

<p>For remedie, it is cravit that the Ladies of Huntlie and Arroll
presently be brought back againe and placit in St Androis, my
Lord Gordone sicklyke to be brought to the south, and put to the
schools&mdash;their friends in the south to be wardit,&mdash;as Cluny, Geight,

Alexander Hay of Auchmather, Mr Alexander Leslie of Peill,

<p class="p1 center">The Commone Corruptiones of all Estates within this

<p>Ane universall coldness and decay of zeale in all estates, joynit
with ignorance and contempt of the word, ministrie, and sacraments;
and qwhere no knowledge is, there is no sense nor feeling,
qwhilk utters itself most manifestly be this, that they want religious
exercises in their families, as of prayer and reading of the word;
and qwhere the samen, for the maist pairt, is abused and profaned
be cuiks, stewarts, jackmen, and such lyke;&mdash;the masters of the
families ashamed to wse their exercises of godliness in their awne
persones, and no conferrence at their tables, but of prophane, wanton,

<p>Superstitione and Idolatrie intertaint, qwhilk utters itself in
keeping of festivall dayes and bonefyres, pilgrimages, singing of
carrolls, and Zuill.</p>

<p>Great blasphemie of the holy name of God in all estates, with
horrible banning and curseing in all their speeches.</p>

<p>Profanation of the Sabbath, and speciallie in seed-tyme and harvest,
and commone journeying on the Sabbath,&mdash;and trysting and
worldlie turnes,&mdash;exerciseing all kynde of wanton games&mdash;keeping

pleyes in law against parentes, and many of them marryes against
their parents’ will and consent, and no care of thair parents for thair

suretie and pledges for their good and dewtifull behaviour and
obedience to his Majestie, in case it shall happen the saids rebelles,
or any uther forraine enemies, to repare within the countrie for disquieting

downe in his Majestie’s letter.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, The reasone moving the Assemblie to grant the mair
willinglie to the two Articles concerning the reproving of his Majestie’s

estate, or the haill estate of his subjects, and uthers of great weight
and importance, that hes not been treatit of before, wold give his
advyce and approbatione therto, before any finall conclusione of

<p>The Assembly ordaynes that there be ane uniformitie in the ordinatione

ane haill registre of their haill proces and proceedings since the acceptatione
of their commission, qwhilk was publickly read in presence
and audience of the haill Assemblie; and because there was
some of the brethren that thought themselves grievit at certaine of

brethren after following, sould cognosce upon the saids grieves and
commissioners’ answers thereto, qwhilk both sould be given in write
before them, and thereafter report to the haill Assemblie, what they
fand therein; They are to say, Mrs George Monro, James Dundas,

<p class="p1 center">Grieves to be proponit to his Majestie.</p>

<p>1. To craue of his Majestie ane reliefe of this present taxatione
to such of the ministrie as possesses small benefices within three
hundreth marks, seeing they are not able to be sustenit upon the
same.</p>

<p>2. To craue, in generall for the haill ministrie, that they be not
troublit with the taxationes in no tyme coming, but that the officers
that ingathers the same, charge the taxmen immediatelie qwho
are bound to relieve the ministrie of their taxatione, because so
long as the Commissioners charges their taksmen, not only it averts
them from their calling, but also breeds a grudge betwixt them
and their parochiners.</p>

<p>3. To craue a redress of the buriall, that ane act of Parliament
may be made, discharging burialls in the kirks.</p>

<p>4. To craue ane redress anent adulterous marriages qwher two
persones, both divorcit for adulterie committit either with uther,
craues the benefite of the Kirk to be joynit in marriage.</p>

<p>5. To craue his Majestie, what order shall be tane anent the
relaxatione of such murtherers from excommunicatione as are already
relaxit from the horne, and yet hes not satisfyit the partie,
qwhilk is a token of no penitence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_467"></a>[467]</span></p>

<p>6. To advyse with his Majestie of the carying of profest witches
from towne to towne, to try witchcraft in wthers, be lawfull and
ordinar tryall of witchcraft or not.</p>

<p>7. Anent laik patronages, to lament unto his Majestie the great
abuse qwhilk the late act of Parliament hes brocht in, giving licence
to the patrone to possesse the fruites of the benefice, in caice he
present ane qwalified man, and the same be not admitted be the
Kirk, under cullour qwherof they use to present ane qualified man
to the presbytrie, and hes him sworne to sett back ane tack of the
fruits of the benefices to the patrone, qwheron, albeit the persone
presentit be qualified, yet the Kirk cannot admitt him, in respect
to the impedimen forsaid, qwherthrough both the patrone uplifts
the fruits of the benefice, and the Kirk lys destitute; therefore to
crave redress.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sess. 5. Martii 9, [Post Meridiem.]</p>

<p>Anent the grieves given in to his Majestie before noon, his Majestie
being present gave his answer as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>To the first and second, his Majestie desyred the Commissioners
to be deput from this Assemblie, to give in ane supplication to the
Councill, anent the same, qwhereunto his Majestie should hold
hand, and in the meantyme promised to cause stay all farther executione
against such of the ministrie as were at the Assembly presently,
qwhill the 15th of Apryle nixt to come.</p>

<p>Anent burialls; his Majestie thought good that ane supplicatione
should be given in to the next Parliament, craving that for
the avoyding of burialls in Kirks, every nobleman sould bigg ane
sepulture for himselfe and his familie.</p>

<p>Anent adulterous marriages; his Majestie thought good that ane
supplicatione should be given in to the next Parliament, craving
such marriages to be declairit null in all tyme coming, and the
bairnes gotten therein, bastards.</p>

<p>Anent murtherers; his Majestie declared, when any murtherer is
relaxit from the horne, upon cautione to underly the law, that he is
not, therefore, simpliciter relaxit, but to ane day to byde tryall of
his fault, and therefore thinks that the Kirk may continow in their
censures against such ane persone, and deny him any benefite of the
Kirk, untill they see evident tokens of repentance in him, the partie
satisfyed, and thereupon ane remission attayned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_468"></a>[468]</span></p>

<p>Anent tryall of witchcraft, his Majestie declarit, that, be ane act
of the last Parliament, it is remittit to certaine of his Heines’ Councill,
certaine ministers and advocats, to conclude upon all solide order
anent tryall of witches, and to advyse whether the forsaid carrying
of witches is permissive or not: touching the qwhilk, the Assemblie
ordaynit Mrs Patrick Galloway and John Duncansone to
hold his Majestie in remembrance.</p>

<p>Anent the abuse in laick patronages, his Majestie thocht good
lykewayes that ane supplicatione sould be given in to the next Parliament
for redress thereof.</p>

<p>Because it was reportit in the Assemblie, that albeit sundry persones
wer convict of witchcraft, nevertheless, the civill magistrate
refusit not only to punische them, conforme to the lawes of the country,
but also, in contempt of the same, setts the persones at liberty,
qwhilks were convict of witchcraft;&mdash;therefore the Assemblie ordaynes
that, in all tyme coming, the presbytrie proceed in all severitie
with their censures against such magistrats as shall sett at
liberty any persone or persones convict of witchcraft hereafter.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, Because diverse persones, with ane preposterous haist, proceed
to the bond of matrimonie, without any lawfull proclamation
of their bands, qwherthrough the ordinances of the Kirk are highly
contemnit; Therefore it is statute and ordaynit, that no persones
be coupled together in marriage, without they be thryce lawfully
proclaimed at their awne paroche kirk, according to the consuetude
observit within the realme; and in caice of contraveining the same,
that the minister be depryvit of his office, and the parties ordayned
to satisfie the Kirk, be publick repentance.</p>

<p>Anent burialls: It is ordaynit that no picturs or images be
carried about in burialls, under the paine of the censures of the
Kirk.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, Because it was regraitit, that certain of the ministrie
being beneficit persones, hes sett tacks and assedationes of the
fruits of their benefice, and thereafter hes obtaynit licence of
transportatione from their kirks, so that the same, be reasone of the
tacks sett be them, remaines continuallie unplantit, for laick of provisione;
Therefore, it is statute and ordaynit that, in tyme coming,
no minister get licence of transportatione from his kirk, before it be
tryit that he hes not hurt the benefice from the qwhilk he craves to
be transportit, be setting tacks of the fruits of the same; and if the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_469"></a>[469]</span>
tacks that were sett before his entrie to the said benefice, expyrit
in his tyme, that he hes renewed no old tack, butt consent of the
Generall Assemblie.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, Because for laick of moyen, sundrie of the ministrie hes not
as yet obtainit designatioune of their manses and gleibs, Therefore
it is ordaynit that every minister, qwhilk is not yet possessit with
his manse and gleib, obtaine possession of the same, betwixt and the
next Assemblie; and in caice the persones in qwhois favours the
designatioune is grantit, be not able, through povertie, to await upon
the law for obtaining possessione of the same, that the rest of the
brethren of his Presbytry concurr and help him with expenses for
obtayning of the same.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sess. 6<sup>a</sup>. Martii 10. Ante Meridiem.</p>

<p>Anent the proceeding of the Commissioners appoyntit in the last
Generall Assemblie, qwhilk they did anent the examinatione of the depositione
of Mr John Rutherford, and the planting of the ministrie of
St Androis: the Assemblie ratifies, approves, and allows their proceedings
therein. And farder, for reasonable causes moving them,
ordaynes Mr Robert Wallace to be relaxit from the suspensione
from his ministry, pronuncit in their decreit against him, be satisfyand
my Lord of Memuor, be the advyce of Mrs David Lyndsay,
Robert Bruce, and Robert Rollock, to the effect he may be placit
to serve in such partes qwher the Kirk shall think his travells to be
best imployit. And as concernyng Mr John Rutherfurd’s proces,
and the rest of the thinges done in St Androis be the saids Commissioners,
Mrs David Black, John Carmichaell, Robert Durie,
Alexander Forsyth, and the rest of the brethren of the Presbytrie
of St Androis that were there present, after reasonyng of such
things qwherof they had not been of before resolvit, declareit themselves
satisfyit therein.</p>

<p>Because it was reportit be the Commission of the Generall Assemblie,
that the constant platt for planting every particular kirk,
be the tacksmen who hes the haill teinds in their hands, and refuseth
to condescend to any substantiall order anent the planting of
the ministrie, without some securitie were made unto them anent
the remanent of their teinds; Therefore, the Assemblie thocht good
to consider qwhat be the conditiones cravit be their tacksmen, in
caice of augmentatione of the dewtie of their tacks for sustentatione
of the ministrie: To the qwhilk it was answerit be the Visitors of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_470"></a>[470]</span>
Morray and Aberdeene, that the taxmen desyrit ane perpetuitie of
their tacks, be renewing thereof at their outruning, butt gressume.
The lyke offerit Angus, Clydsdale; Gallaway, Fyfe, and Lawthiane,
wald make no offer; upon consideratione qwhereof, the brethren
desyrit his Majestie that ane law might be made anent the augmentation
of the dewties of the tacks for sustentatione of the ministrie,
To the qwhilk his Majestie offerit willingly to deall with the tacksmen
in such sorte that they should be forced to augment the dewtie
of their tacks to ane reasonable and competent living for ane minister
at every kirke, upon condition they had some reasonable ease of
their teinds; and for effectuating thereof, the Assemblie ordaynes
every minister to give in ane particular overture in wryte to the
Commissioners quwhilk shall be appoyntit be the Generall Assemblie,
quhat is the just valour of the teinds of his paroche, to quham
they are sett, for quhat dewtie, to quham the deutie is payit, and
quhat better every ane can give for planting of his awne kirk, to
the effect his Majestie, with advyce of the saids Commissioners,
may take ane solide order anent the sufficient planting of every particular
kirk betwixt and the nixt Generall Assemblie.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sess. 7. Martii 10.</p>

<p>The brethren appoynted to try the proceedings of the Commissioners
of the last Assemblie, and the grieves given in against the
same, with the Commissioners’ answers thereto, declairit that they
had considerit the haill grieves given in be the Synodall of Lawthiane,
and the Commissioners’ answers made to the same, and that
they thought it expedient, so that it were the will of the Assemblie,
that the saids grieves and answers sould be buried;&mdash;nottheless, the
Assemblie, for the satisfaction of the haill breither, thocht good,
that the saids grieves and answers sould be read in audience of the
haill Assemblie; qwhilk being done, after voteing, it was concluded
that the proces and proceedings of the saids Commissioners
sould be ratified in that part, and the grieves and answers buried
and obliterat, for continuance of peace in the Kirk.</p>

thereto, to be buried and put out of memorie. For better executione<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_471"></a>[471]</span>

Gladstones, or any fyve of them, to conveine with his Majestie, to
put the decreit of the saids Commissioners, anent the planting of
Edinburgh, to farther executione, and place the ministers of Edinburgh
at their particular flockes; ordayning likewise the ministers
of Edinburgh to obey the said decreit, be accepting every ane of
them their particular flocks, under the paine of deprivatione of them

concurr with his Heines to that effect, nevertheless, his Majestie’s
mynde is, no wayes to trouble the Commissioners with any such matters,
unless first it be notoriously knawne, that the presbytrie,
quhere the offender maks residence, both has gotten knowledge of
the fact, and either has altogether neglectit the tryall thereof, or

<p class="p1 center">Sess. 11. 13 Martii.</p>

<p>Forsuameikle as the Commissioners of the Generall Assemblie, at
the Parliament halden in December last bypast, upon ane earnest
zeall quhilk they did alwayes bear to the will of the Kirk, had given
in certaine article to the Lords of Parliament, concernying the liberty
of the Kirk, and in speciall had cravit that the ministrie, as
representing the trew Kirk of God within this realme, and so being
the third estate of the realme, might have vote in Parliament according
to the loveable acts and constitutions of before made in Parliament,
in favours of the freedome and libertie of the Holy Kirk,
qwhilks their travells and indeavours, proceeding alwayes upon ane
godly intentione, they submittit to the censures of this present Assemblie,
desyring the brethren to allow or disallow the same, as they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_474"></a>[474]</span>
should think most expedient, for the glory of God and establisching
of the trew religione within this realme: Qwherupon the brethren
being ryply advysit, allowit the honest and godly intentione of the
Commissioners in craving vote in Parliament for the ministrey, as
conforme and agrieing with sundrie uther Acts of the Assemblies
proceeding, in the qwhilks it hes been found expedient that the
Kirk sould sute vote in Parliament.</p>

<p>Forsuameikle as his Majestie is willing to utter his good intention
that he hes alwayes borne to the establisching of the trew Kirk
of God within this realme, declareit, that for the better performance
thereof, his Hienes had assistit the Commissioners of the last Assemblie
in craving vote in Parliament in name of the Kirk, qwhilk their
sute, albeit in some part, and as it were, in a certain manner, granted
be the Lords of Parliament, yet the acceptatione therof, the forme
and haill circumstances of the persones were reservit to this Generall
Assemblie, to be acceptit or refuisit as the Kirk should think expedient:
And seeing his Majestie had anticipat the appoynted tyme
of the Assemblie, and desyrit the brethren to conveine at this present
tyme, especially for the causes forsaid; therefore his Majestie
desyrit that the brether wold enter in a particular consideratione of
the haill poynts of the said act in every particular poynt thereof,
and first to reason in publick audience of the haill Assemblie,
qwhither it was lawful and expedient, that the ministrie, as representing
undoubtedly the Kirk within this realme, should have
vote in Parliament or not?</p>

<p>The said question being at lenth reasoned and debaitit <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in utramque
partem</i>, in presence of the haill brethrene, and therafter votit,
The Generall Assemblie votes, finds, and concludes, that it is necessar
and expedient for the well of the Kirk, that the Ministry, as
third Estate of this realme, in name of the Kirk, have vote in Parliament.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sess. 12. Martii 14.</p>

<p>Concerning the number of the ministry that should have vote in
Parliament in name of the Kirk, it was lykewise concludit and
thought expedient, that alse many of them sould be chosen for the
vote in Parliament as was wont of old, in the tyme of the Papisticall
Kirk, to be Bischops, Abbots, and Priors, that had the lyke
libertie, viz. to the number of fyftie and ane, or thereby.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, After reasoning, it was votit and concludit that the election<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_475"></a>[475]</span>
of such of the ministrie as should have vote in Parliament
aucht to be of ane mixt qualitie, and appertayne pairtly to his Majestie,
and pairtly to the Kirk; and because, throw shortness of
tyme, the brethren could not be perfectly resolvit in the remanent
heads and circumstances concernyng the office of him that should
have vote in Parliament, viz. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de modo eligendi</i>, of his rent, of the
continuance of his office, qwhither he should be chosen <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad pœnam</i>
or not, of his name, of the cautiones for the preservation of him
from corruptione, and such uther circumstances; Therefore, the
Assemblie ordaynes every Presbytrie to be ryply and throwghly
advysit with the particular heads above written, and thereafter to
convocat their Synodall Assemblies through the haill countrey upon
ane day, qwhilk shall be the first Tuesday of Junii nixt to come,
and there, after new reasoning and advysement with the particular
heads above written, that every Synodall choose out three of the
wysest of their number, qwho shall be ready upon his Majestie’s
advertisement, qwhilk shall be upon ane moneth’s warning at the
leist, to convein with his Majestie, together with Doctors of the
Universities, viz. Mrs Andrew Melvill, John Johnstone, Robert
Rollock, Patrick Chaip, Robert Harvie, Robert Wilkie, and James
Martine, such day and place as his Majestie shall think expedient;
with power to them to treat and reasone and conferre upon the
saids heads and uthers appertayning therto, and in caice of agreement
and uniformitie of opinions, to vote and conclude the haill
questione concernyng vote in Parliament; utherwayes, in caice of
discrepance and variance, to referr the conclusione thereof to the
nixt Generall Assemblie.</p>

<p>For better observing of the Presbytries, It is statute and ordaynit,
that every Presbytrie shall assemble themselves ance orderly,
ilk week in their full number, at the leist so many of them as hes
their residence within aucht myles to the place of the ordinarie
conventione of the Presbytrie: That every member of the Presbytrie
study the text qwherupon the exercise is to be made: That
ane common head of religion be intreatit every moneth in ilk Presbytrie,
both by way of discourse and disputatione: That every
pastor have ane weekly exercise of instructione and examinatione
of ane pairt of his congregatione in the Catechisme; Qwhilk haill
heads are ordained to be observed under the paine of incurring the
censures of the Kirk.</p>

<p class="p1 center">Sess. ultima. 14 Martii, Post Meridiem.</p>

<p>The brethren having read and considerit the paines and travells
taken be Mr Patrick Scharp, Principall of the Colledge of Glasgow,
and his Lessones upon the Catechisme and grounds of religione,
allowes of the same, and thinks them very necessar and profitable;
and therefore ordaynes them to be printed.</p>

<p>Anent the protestation given in be Mr John Davidsone, for himself
and in name of certaine uther brethren as he alleadgit, protesting
that this Assemblie was not ane frie Assemblie, qwhilk his protestatione
he desyrit to be insert in the Books of the Assemblie:</p>

<p>It being inquyrit if any man wald adhere to the said protestatione,
there was nane found that wald adhere to the samen, nor was
of the said Mr John’s opinion thereanent; and therefore the brethren
dischargit the Clerk to insert the same in the Books of the Assemblie.</p>

<p>Because the questione anent summar excommunicatione, for lake
of tyme, cannot be commodiously intreatit at this present, therefore
the brethren continows the same to nixt Assemblie: in the meintyme
suspends all summar executione.</p>

<p>Because there hes no order [been] sett downe hitherto anent the
number of Commissioners to be direct from every Presbytrie to the
Generall Assemblie, Therefore it is statute and ordaynit that in all
tyme coming, three of the wysest and gravest of the brethren shall
be direct from every Presbytrie at the maist, as Commissioners to
every Assemblie, and that nane presume to come butt commission,
except they have ane speciall complaint, and that the Clark of the
Assemblie take heed to receave no mair in commission but three
alanarlie, as said is; and lykewayes that ane be direct from every
Presbytrie in name of Barrones, and ane out of every Burgh except
Edinburgh, qwhilk shall have power to direct two Commissioners
to the Generall Assemblie.</p>

<p>Anent the supplicatione given in be the Towne of Dundie, craving
ane uther minister to be appoyntit unto them in place of William
Chrystisone, who through age is not able to discharge his calling:
The brethren thought their desyre reasonable; and having
appoyntit on the leets Mr John Hall, minister at Leith, and Mr
Robert Howie, Principall of the New Colledge of Aberdeen, be
pluralitie of votes, Mr Robert Howie was chosen to be minister of
Dundie, and ordainit to be transportit with all possible diligence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_477"></a>[477]</span></p>

<p>Because it was reportit that the ministrey of Orknay had dilapidat
their benefices be selling of tacks of the rent of the same, to the
great hurt and prejudice of the kirks, Therefore it is statute and
ordaynit, that nane of the ministrie of Orknay or Zetland sett any
tacks of any pairt of the fruits of their benefices, nor yet give their
consent to the tacks that shall be sett be wthers, in ony tyme coming,
under the paine of deprivatione.</p>

<p>Because it was reportit be certaine of the brethrene that notwithstanding
of the acts of the Assemblies proceeding against saillors,
and traffiquers with Spaine, the said traffique was not indmittit,
Therefore the Assembly ordaines the acts made anent the said traffiquers
to be put in farther executione in all poynts, butt any respect
of persons.</p>

<p>The Assemblie hes ordained the Presbytries of Dundee and Arbroth

<p>The Commissioners appoyntit in the last Generall Assemblie for
visitatione of the kirks within every presbytrie, as are particularly
divided in the said commission, being requyrit what diligence they
had done in discharge of the said Commission; It was answerit for
the maist pairt of them, that they were not able to discharge any
pairt of the said Commission, in respect they wantit moyen for to
make their expences dureing the tyme of the visitatione, and therefore
the Assembly thocht good that it should be meint to his Majestie
that through inlake of expences the wark of visitatione was
lyke to cease, and to crave some remeid thereto.</p>

<p>Forswameikle as it was regraitit that the act made in the last
Assemblie, anent the ordinare keeping of Presbytries, and the
resorting thereto, was not regarded be sundrie of the ministrie, and
speciallie be them of the presbytries of Irvine and Aire, Therefore
the Generall Assemblie ordaynes the said act to be put in executione,

<p>Anent the supplicatione given in be the Synodall of Galloway,
making mention that qwher they had ane act for erecting and bigging
of ane kirk at the burgh of Stranrawer, within the Presbytrie
of Wigtoune, and annexatione thereto of the 20 pound land of the
parochine of Inche, lyand toward the cost of Irleand, pertayning to
the Lairds of Garthland, Stranrawer, Kinlult and Sorby, with the
29 mark land of the parochine of Salsett, the five mark land of
Auchteraire, and five merk land of Stranrawer, as being most commodious
for the inhabitants of the saids lands to resorte to the said
kirk for hearing of the word; unto the qwhilk erection and annexation
foresaids, the heretors and kyndlie tennents of the foresaids
lands hes already given their consent, desyrand, therefore, that the

ratifies and approves the erecting and annexatione foresaid,
made be the Synodall of Galloway in all poynts.</p>

<p>Because the generall questione was proponit to the haill Assemblie,
qwhere congregationes are so spacious, that a great pairt thereof
may not commodiously resort to their awne paroche kirk, be
reasone of the great distance of habitation therefrae,&mdash;If it be lawfull
to ane number of the said congregatione to big ane new kirk,
and intertaine ane pastor at the same tyme upon their awn expenses?
The Generall Assemblie, after long reasonyng, thinks it
both lawfull and expedient, and declares they will assist the same
as ane godly work, and will crave the samen to be ratified in Parliament,
how so oft it shall occurre.</p>

<p>Because it was reportit that a great number of gentlemen and
wthers of this realme willfully and obstinatly abstaines from the
holy communion, some under cullour of deedly feud, and some for
wthers light causes: Therefore, for remeid of the said abuse, it is
statute and ordaynit, that all presbytries within this realme give
expresse charge and command to every particular minister within
their bounds, charging them to take up the names of all them within
their parochine, qwho hes not communicat ilk year ance at the

non-communicants, remaining obstinat, and the saids three

against them; and in the parochines qwhere there is no minister,
that this order be supplied be the presbytry within the

<p>Forsuameikle as it was lamentit in the King’s Majestie’s presence,
that qwhereas syndrie of the ministry were occupied in their laudable
calling in pursuing of malefactors, such as adulterers, murtherers,
and uthers sclanderous persons, urging them to purge the
sclanders committit be them, conforme to the statuts of the Kirk,

underwritten, to be given in to the next Conventione:</p>

<p>1. That all Jesuites, Seminarie Priests, excommunicat and traffiquing
Papists, that shall happen in any tyme coming to returne
within the countrey, or that are presently within the countrey, shall,
immediately after their dilatione to his Majestie, be apprehendit and
put in ward, there to be detinit ay and qwhill they be convertit to
the religion, or else punischit according to the acts of parliament,
or else removit off the countrie.</p>

<p>2. That the resetters of obstinat excommunicat Papists and their
chief friends and acquaintance quhois house they haunt, be chargit
to find cautione, under a pecuniall pain according to their abilitie
and rank, that they shall no wayes resett nor intertaine the saids
excommunicats.</p>

<p>3. That all excommunicat Papists be chargit to satisfy the Kirk
within the space of thrie moneths, under the payne of hornyng, and
if they failʒie, to be denuncit therto, that their escheits and lyferents,
in caice of year and dayes rebellion, may be intromittit with
be his Majestie’s Thesaurer, and not disponit to any donators.</p>

<p>4. That the Marquess of Huntlie be chargit to exhibit and present

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_481"></a>[481]</span>Newtoune, Patrick Butter, and Mr Alex<sup>r</sup>. Leslie, according to his
band, that they may be committit to ward ay and whill they satisfy
the Kirk.</p>

<p>Bonytowne, younger, alleadgit resident within the Presbytries of
Ellone, Aberdeene, and Brechine, is ordaint be the Generall Assemblie

<p>Tarves and Methlek, kirks of the Synodall of Aberdeen, upon
the 11th of November 1597, with mutuall consent of the parochiners
and heritors of the lands to be interchangit and annexit with consent
of the said Synodall, excambit certain lands, and annexit them
in respect of the far distance from their awne paroche kirks, and
contiguitie of the kirks qwherunto they are annexit, but prejudice
alwayes of their rents of the personage and viccarage of the saids
lands to be payed to the old persones and viccars, as before the said
excambione. The Generall Assemblie, at the desyre of the said
Synodall, ratifies and approves the said excambione and alteratione
in all poynts, and ordains the same to take full effect.</p>

<p>Forsuameikle as diverse and great inconveinents aryses dayly be
the untymous marriage of young and tender persones before they
come to age meit for marriage, and that there is no law nor statute
of the Kirk made as yet defyning the age of persones to be maried;
Therefore it is statute and ordaynit, that no minister within this
realme presume to joyne in matrimonie any persones in tyme comeing
except the man be of fourteen yeares and the woman of twelve
yeares at the leist; ordayning lykewayes the Commissioners of the
Generall Assemblie to desyre this statute to be ratified in the Conventione.</p>

<p>Anent the questione qwhether if a man being blind may discharge
all the pairts of the office of a pastor, and in speciall anent the admission
of Mr John Boyll to the ministry of Jedburgh, being blind:
the Assemblie refers the answer of the generall questione to the nixt
Generall Assemblie. And as to the admission of the said Mr John,
refers the tryall thereof to the Commissioners of the Generall Assemblie;
and in the meintyme discharges the said Mr John of using
any part the office of a pastor, except the preaching of the word.</p>

<p>Because the marriage of persones convict of adulterie is a great
alurement to married persones to committ the said cryme, thinking
thereby to be separat from their awne lawfull wyfes, to injoy the
persones with qwham they have committed adulterie: ffor eschewing
qwhereof, the Generall Assemblie thinks it expedient that ane<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_482"></a>[482]</span>
supplicatione be giuen in to the nixt Conventione, cravand ane act
to be made, dischargeing all marriages of sic persones as are convict

<p>Anent the supplicatione given in be James Lermonth, younger
of Darsie, David Kynnithmonth of that Ilk, John Traill of Blebow,
for themselves, and in name of their tennents and wthers, parochiners<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_485"></a>[485]</span>

are parochiners of the said paroche kirk, lykeas they and their predicessors
hes beene continually subject to the discipline of the said
kirk, and hes been ever ready to underly qwhatsoever burden was
imposit for furtherance of the said kirk, and concurre with the rest
of the parochiners according to their rent and portione of the said
paroche; nevertheless the minister and sessione of the said kirk refuses
to suffer them and their saids tennents to enjoy the benefites of
the kirk with the remanent of the said paroche, but debarres them
from the hearing of the word, receaving of the sacraments, and benefite
of marriage, within the said kirk, butt any reasonable cause;
desyrand, therefore, ane command to the minister and session of the
said kirk of St Androis to admitt the forsaids persones and their
vassals to the hearing of the word and injoying of the haill forsaids
benefites of the kirk, as at mair lenth is contained in the said supplicatione.</p>

<p>The Generall Assemblie having considerit the haill premisses,
commands and ordaynes the ministry and session of the said kirk
of St Androis to admitt the saids complainers, and their vassals and
tennents, parochiners of the said kirk, to the hearing of the word,
mariage, and receaving of the sacraments of the kirk, within the
said kirk of St Androis, as their proper paroche kirk in all tyme

<p>Anent the supplicatione given in be the parochiners of Twlliebodie,
making mentione, That albeit the said parochine be ane auld
parochine, separate from all wthers, having within itself the number
of four or fyve hundreth communicants or therby, and payes their
teynds to the Abbot of Cambuskenneth, who rigorously exacts the
same; neverthelesse the Presbytrie of Striviling hes be their ordinance
commandit the said kirk to be united to the chappell of
Alloway maist wrangously, seeing the saids complainers, be ane anterior
command of the said Presbytrie, not only re-edified their
said kirke of Twllibodie, but also upon their awne charges furnishit
ane pastor to the said kirk, lykeas yet they are willing to doe, notwithstanding
that their teinds are most wrangouslie led away be the
said Abbot, as said is; desyreing, therefore, their supplication to
be considerit, and the said union dissolved, as at mair lenth is containt
in the said supplicatione.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_486"></a>[486]</span></p>

<p>The brethrene of the Presbytrie of Striviling being callit to give
a reason of this their union of the said kirk, answerit that the cause
moving them was, <em>First</em>, That both the said paroches lay very commodiously
to the said kirk of Alloway; <em>Secondly</em>, That the number of
both the saids parochines wald make but ane sufficient congregatione;
<em>Thirdly</em>, That there could not be ane stipend obtainit to the
said kirk of Twllibodie, in so far that at the desyre of the saids complainers,
there being ane pastor appoyntit to the said kirk, upon
promise that they wald furnische him ane sufficient stipend, ware
forcit, for povertie, to leave them; qwhereas be the contrare, be the
union of the said two kirks, the Earle of Mar furnisches ane sufficient
stipend to ane minister, resident at the same.</p>

<p>The Generall Assemblie having considered the premisses, ratifies
and approves the union of the said two kirks, and ordayns Alloway
to be the paroche kirk hereafter.</p>

<p>Anent the supplicatione given in be the Presbytry of Deir,
makand mention, that qwhair the Laird of Phillorthe having erect
ane Colledge upon the town of Fraserburgh, and agreed with Mr
Charles Ferme to be both Pastor of the said burgh, and Principall
of his Colledge, qwhilk burden the said Mr Charles refuses to accept
upon him, without he be commandit be the Generall Assembly;
desyrand, therefore, ane command to be given to the said Mr
Charles to accept both the said charges, as at mair lenth is containt
in the said supplication: The Generall Assemblie having
considered the necessity of the said warke, and how the said Laird
of Phillorthe hes refusit to sustaine ane pastor at the said kirk,
unless he undertake both the saids charges, Therefore commands
and charges the said Mr Charles Ferme to undertake and awayte

<p class="p1 center">Sessio 8. Martii 22. Post Meridiem.</p>

<p>Forsuameikle as the Commissioners of the Synodalls conveint at
Falkland, the 25th of July 1598, being of divers opiniones concerning
the continuance of this commission that shall have vote in Parliament,
qwether he sould endure for his lyfetyme, except some
cryme of offence interveine, or for a schorter tyme, at the pleasure of the
Kirk, they thocht good to referre the same to this present Assemblie?
Therefore, having reasonit at lenth the said questione, after voiting
of the samen, ffinds and declares that he shall <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">annuatim</i> give compt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_487"></a>[487]</span>
of his commission obtained at the Assemblie, and lay down the same
at their feet, to be continowit or alterit therfrae be his Majestie
and the Assemblie, as the Assemblie, with consent of his Majestie,
sall think most expedient for the weill of the Kirk.</p>

<p>It is statute and ordaynit, that nane of them that shall have vote
in Parliament shall come as Commissioners to any Generall Assemblie,
nor have vote in the same in any tyme coming, except he
be authorized with a commission from his own presbytry to that
effect.</p>

<p>It is found be the Assemblie that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crimen ambitus</i> shall be a sufficient
cause of deprivatione of him that shall have vote in Parliament.</p>

<p>It is statute and ordaynit, that every minister intimat this Generall
Assemblie that the vote in Parliament is concludit be the
Assemblie, and that nane utter speech in pulpit contrare the same.</p>

<p>Forsuameikle as it hes been found necessare of before, and profitable
for the will of the Kirk, that certaine Commissioners be appoyntit
frae Assemblie to Assemblie, qwhois speciall care and travell
sould be to give their advyce to his Majestie in all affairs
concernyng the weell of the Kirk, and intertainment of peace and
concord betwixt his Majestie and the Kirk; Therefore, the Generall

lykeas be the tenor heirof they give and grants, their full power and
commission to Mrs James Strachane, James Nicolsone, Andrew
Milne, Alex<sup>r</sup>. Forbes, Alexander Dowglass, Robert Howie, James

Mrs David Lyndsay, Robert Bruce, James Nicolsone, Andrew
Lambe, William Couper, Alexander Lyndsay, John Spottswood,
with the King’s Majestie’s Ministers.</p>

<p>Because it was understand be the Assemblie that Mr Androw
Lamb, minister at Aberbrothick, licklie to be transportit to some
other flock, qwher his gifts might profite the Kirk in greater abundance,
therefore the Generall Assemblie gives licence to the said
Mr Androw to be transportit from the said kirk of Aberbrothock.</p>

<p>The said day, the Generall Assemblie receivit and admittit Mr
Thomas Hope to be Solicitor for the Kirk in place of James Mowat,&mdash;qwho
being personally present, dimittit the same in the Assemblie’s
hands,&mdash;after the said Mr Thomas had given his oath of
fidelitie in the said office.</p>

<p>Anent the proces of appellatione persueit be James Lord Lyndsay
of Byres, and remanent gentlemen and parochiners of the paroche
of Syres, against the Presbytries of Couper and St Androis, concernyng
the admissione of Mr Robert Buchanane, Provest of Kirkheuch,
to the ministrie at the kirk of Syres, and transportatione of him
from the kirk of Forgane in Fyfe; the brethren that were appoyntit
to visite the said proces, having made their report to the haill Assembly,
the rights, reasons, and allegations of all the saids Presbytries

Melvill, Robert Wilkie, James Nicolsone, Alexander Lyndsay, and
William Scott, givand them power to elect and chuse out a discreet

recommends to them their brother, Mr William Simpsone, minister
at Bruntisland.</p>

<p>Forsuameikle as there is diverse partes of the countrey that for
lake of visitatione are become almost desolate, Therefore the Generall
Assemblie hes thocht good that certaine visitors be direct for

weel of the Kirk, and to report to the nixt Generall Assemblie.</p>

<p>Because the Island of Errane lyes most commodious and adjacent

makand mention, That seeing the Presbytrie had united the kirks
of Essie and Niva to be and remain a congregatione under the

fyve hundreth persones, partly in respect of the commoditie of the
place, seeing the farthest part of both the saids paroches will not
be distant halfe ane myle from the place qwhere the kirk sould be
biggit, and partly in respect of the impossibility of the moyen to
sustaine two sundry ministers at the saids kirks; Desyreing, therefore,
ane ratificatione of the unione in this Assemblie, together with
ane command to the brethren direct to the Estates conveint at
Perth, to crave the samyn to be ratifyit in the said Conventione&mdash;as

done wrang in planting of the kirk of Dalgatie with the hurt and
prejudice of the kirk of Aberdour, being the greatest and most populous

<p>The qwhilk day the brethren having interet in consideratione
of the generall defectione from the puritie, practise, and
zeall of trew religione in all estates of the countrie, and how the
samen must, of necessitie, at the last, be concludit either in Papistrie
or atheisme within schort space in the righteous judgement
of God, except some substantious remedie be provydit thereto in
tyme, and because the evill cannot be well curit unless the originall
springs and speciall causes thereof be rypet up, Therefore
the brethren, after mature deliberatione and weighing of the
causes of the said defection, hes found the principall causes thereof
to be as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>Causes of the Defection from the Puritie, Zeall, and Practise
of trew Religion in all Estates of the Countrie, and how the
same may be most effectuallie remeadit, &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p>The principall causes of this fearfull change, no doubt, is the just
wrath of God kindled against the haill land for the unreverent estimatione
of the Gospell, and for the sinnes of all estates, and dishonouring
of thair professione, and makeing the name of God to be
blasphemit be the profane world without remorse&mdash;laicke of care
and diligence upon the part of the ministry in the discovery of
them that maks apostacie to papistrie, and negligence in executione
of the lawes and discipline against such as happens to be discoverit.</p>

<p>Want of pastors and unplantit kirks, and displanting of kirks,
qwhilk hes been provydit be the diminutione of the thirds.</p>

<p>Neglecting of places that are of chiefest importance to the interest
of Religion in not planting sufficient pastores thereat, such as are
hir Majestie’s hous, the Prince’s hous, the Earles of Huntlie, Erroll,
and Angus’ houses and places of their chiefest residence, the Lord
Hoome’s house, the Lord Heress’ house, and chief places of their
residence, the Town of Dumfreis, and uthers of the nobilitie and
greatest power within the countrey.</p>

<p>The overhastie admissione of men to the ministrie before they
be knawne to be of sufficient gifts and experience to discharge fruitfully
that hich calling in thir difficult tymes.</p>

<p>The negligence of the ministry in the advanceing of their knawledge
be ever continuall and constant reading of the Scriptures and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_492"></a>[492]</span>
contraversies of the tyme, qwherthrow they might be able to bring
the consciences of their auditors in subjectione to the obedience of
the Gospell, and convince of the adversarie.</p>

<p>Negligence in the lyves of the ministry&mdash;not framing their conversatione
in gravitie as paterns of lyfe to the people, but framing
them excessively to the humours of men, especially in communications
at tables, and giving sumtyme examples of intemperance in
the light and prodigall abulziements of their families.</p>

<p>The distraction of minds qwhilk is supposed to be in the ministry&mdash;the
distraction qwhilk is supposed to be of his Majestie’s mynde
from some of the ministry.</p>

<p>The advancing of men suspect in religione, and knawne to be
evill affectit to the good cause, unto offices, honour, and credite in
court, counsell, and sessione, and wther rowmes of great importance
within the countrey.</p>

<p>The desolatione of the Kirk of Edinburgh, through the want of
pastors.</p>

<p>The continuall residence and intertainment of the Ladie Huntly,
ane knawne and profest Papist, of Margaret Wood, sister to the
Laird of Bonytowne, and wthers knawne and profest Papists, in his
Majestie’s court and company.</p>

<p>The educatione of their Majesties’ children in the company of
profest and obstinate Papists, sic as the Ladie Livingstone.</p>

<p>The negligent education of the children of noblemen, and sending
of them out of the country under the charge of pedagogues suspect
in religione, or, at the leist, not weill grundit and confirmit therein,
to be broucht up and instructed in places qwher Papistrie is profest.</p>

<p>The impunitie of skippers, mariners, and owners of ships, that
under the name of passengers, transports from uther places, and
brings Papists, with their coffers, Seminarie Priests, Jesuites, and
uthers trafficquers within the countrey, and the impunitie of such
as carreyes and sparpells their books through the countrie.</p>

<p>The decaye of schooles and educatione of the youth in the knawledge
of good letters and godliness, especially to landwart, for lake
of sufficient provision to intertaine a qualified schoolmaster in
places needfull.</p>

<p class="p1 center">Remedies of the former Evills.</p>

<p>The Generall Assemblie, having enterit in the consideratione of
the causes of the said great and fearfull defectione of all estates of
persones of this land from the trew and sincere professione of the
gospell, presently sounding within the same; and having found the
principall causes of this fearfull change to be, no doubt, the just
wrath of God kindlit against the haill land, for the unreverend
estimatione of the gospell, and for the sinnes of all estates, and dishonouring
of their professione, and making the name of God to be
blasphemit be the profane world without remorse: qwhilks horrible
judgments hes fallen in every estate, for the contemptuous hearing
of the word of God, in so far as there is nane that hes worthilie
esteemit the said precious word according to the dignitie thereof;
therefore, and for removing of the former evills and caus of farther
judgements, if they be not preventit be speedie repentance, the
Assemblie hes concludit and ordainit ane generall humiliatione to
be keepit solemnly throughout the haill land, with fasting and
prayer, two severall Sabbath days in all congregationes, both in
burgh and land, within this realme; and lykewise in burrow townes,
the haill week betwixt the said two Sondays, and the cause of the
said humiliatione to be only the sinnes of the land, be the qwhilks
the profession of the gospell hes been dishonourit, and the wrath of
God provockit; qwhilk generall humiliatione is ordaynit to be upon
the last two Sabbaths of June nixt to come.</p>

<p>The unplantit kirks wald be effectuallie recommendit to his Majestie’s
care, qwhais authoritie only is able to accomplishe that wark;
and for the better furtherance thereof, that his Majestie wald cause
take heed that the thirds be keepit unvitiat. Nothing more necessar
nor to have his Majestie’s houss, the Prince’s houss, the Earles’
housses, and places of their residence, and wthers places of chiefest
importance, as the town of Dumfries, to be well plantit with learnit,
godly, and wyse persones; and qwhere the laike of provisione
might be ane hinder to the present planting, as at the Earles’ houses,
it were requisite for a tyme that the meetest for that purpose, not
being in places where the cause may be so far interest be the want
of a resident pastor, sould be transportit fra their awn places, to
remaine for ane quarter or halfe ane year, that ane substantious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_494"></a>[494]</span>
meine may be found out for ane constant provisione and planting
of these rowmes, be qwhais labors, in the meantyme, the Earles and
their families might be confirmit in the truth, and the enemies debarrit
from their companies, and thereafter to return to their awne
charges; the Presbytries, in the meaneqwhile, taking order for
helping of their kirks in tyme of their absence; and to that effect,
ordaynes Mr George Gladstanes to be direct to awayte upon the
Earle of Huntlie; Messrs Alex<sup>r</sup>. Lindsay and William Cowper upon
the Earle of Erroll; Messrs James Law and John Spotswood upon
the Earle of Angus; Mr John Carmichaell upon the Lord Hoome;
Messrs David Lyndsay and John Hall upon the Lord Heres.</p>

<p>That ane petition be given in to his Majestie and Secret Councill,
desyring that these qwham his Majestie knawes, or shall knaw
hereafter, to deale in favours of profest traffiqueing Papists farther
nor the lawes of the countrey shall permitt, shall be comptit and
holden as men suspect in religione, and shall not have the honour
to be in his Majestie’s house, counsell, or sessione.</p>

<p>That it be cravit lykewise of his Majestie and Secret Councill, that
all Papists, men and women, challengit be the kirk for their religione,
and not satisfyand the kirk for the same, be dischargit from
resort to court, qwhill they have satisfyit and bring from the Presbytrie
of their bounds ane sufficient testimoniall of their obedience.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, For disobedience of the adversaries of trew religione lurking
within this countrie, it is ordaynit that every Presbytrie, immediately
after the dissolving of this present Assembly, take up the
names of the new communicants within their bounds, and send them
to his Majestie’s ministers with all expeditione, subscrivit be the
moderator and clark of the Presbytrie, and minister of the paroche,
and that from this tyme furth, at every Provinciall Assemblie, the
names of the non-communicants be tane up, and sent up to his
Majestie’s ministers.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, That it be inquyrit anent the late reconcilit Lords to the
kirk, be the Presbytries qwher they make residence, qwhether they
have keepit and performit the articles subscrivit be them at the receaving,
and that they be urgit severally to perform every ane of
the saids articles, and if they refuse, that the Presbytries certifie the
King’s Majestie’s ministers thereof.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, For escheweing of farther evill qwhilk might come to the
estate of religione be the evill educatione of the youth furth of the
country, it wald be cravit of his Majestie and Secret Councill,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_495"></a>[495]</span>
qwhen such noblemen and wthers as directs ane pedagogue with
their sonnes furth of the country, that their pedagogue be knawne
godly and of good religione, learnit and instructit in the same, and
approvit in his religione be the testimoniall of his Presbytrie; that
their remaining out of the country be in places qwher religione is
presently professit, or, at the least, qwher there is no restraint of the
same be the cruelty of inquisitione; that dureing the tyme of their
absence they shall not haunt any idolatrous exercise of religione;
and such as hes not the moyen to sustaine ane pedagogue with their
sonnes furth of the country, that they send them to such pairts
qwher there is no restraint of religione; and in caice their sonnes,
after their depairting out of the countrey, haunt these parts qwher
the profession of the trew religione is restraint, that they find caution
not to intertaine them: And in caice any that passes furth of
the countrey imbrace any religione except that qwhilk is presently
profest within this realm, that they shall not be able to brooke
moyen, heritage, honours, nor offices, within this realme; and this
to be ane exception against the service of their brieves, and at the
tyme of admissione of them to any office or honours, and in caice
any of their parents contraveine any of the premisses, that they incurre
such paine as his Majestie and Secret Councill shall modifie,
and that such as are already out of the country, either be callit back
againe before ane day to be appoyntit be his Majestie and Secret
Councill, or else that their parents be subject to the lyke conditiones
as is before sett downe.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, It wald be cravit of his Majestie and Secret Councill, that
all skippers, mariners, and owners of ships, be inhibite that they
bring in any Jesuites, Seminary Priests, declarit fugitive traytors and
rebells within the countrie, but such as they knaw to be of good
religione, or hes sufficient testimoniall of their honesty in religion,
from the places qwher they have been conversant, under the paine
of escheating their haill goods, and under the same payns, that they
deliver them in the hands of the magistrate of the toune or port
qwher they shall happen to arryve at, there to be keepit, ay and
qwhill they be examinat, and his Majestie’s warrant obtainit for
their liberty after they have been tryit and fand honest in religione,
and shall keep them, their goods, books, and geir in schipboard, ay
and qwhill they receive ane warrand, or the ordinarie magistrate
for relieving of the same; and to that effect, they sett nane upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_496"></a>[496]</span>
land but in common parts, qwher there is ane magistrate to receave
the passengers from their hands.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, That his Majestie be dealt earnestly with anent the removeing
of his dochter out of the Lady Livingstone’s company, in respect
of her obstinate continuing in the professione of Papistry, for the
qwhilk cause, his Majestie being requestit be the haill Assemblie,
promised that his Heines’ daughter sould be transportit betwixt and
Martimes next to come to his awne house.</p>

<p>And because of the nane planting of kirks is ane great part of
the wyte of defection from the puritie of religione, and that the
best way for the planting of the saids kirks is the furtherance of the
constant platt for locall stipends to be appoyntit to every kirk within
this realme, therefore the Assemblie hes ordaynit the brethren following,
viz., Messrs David Lyndsay, James Nicolsone, Robert Pont,
Patrick Galloway, George Gladstones, John Nicolsone, or any three
of them, to conveen upon the first day of Junii with my Lords
Chancellour, President, Secretar, Collector, Comptroller, Sir Patrick
Morray, Mr George Young, to intreat and advyse upon such overtures
as be their common consent shall be found most meet and
expedient for advancing of the warke of the constant platt, and to
lay doune such grunds as they shall finde most profitable for prosecuting
of the same, and to reporte their diligence to the nixt Assemblie.</p>

errors that meritit to be correctit in the vulgar translation of the
Bible, of the Psalmes in meter, as also that there was sundrie prayers
in the Psalme Book qwhilk wald be alterit, in respect they are not

hes concludit as follows: First, anent the translatione of the Bible,
that every ane of the brethrene wha hes best knawledge in the
languages imploy their travells in syndrie pairts of the vulgar translatione
of the Bible that needs to be mendit, and to conferr the

prayers eikit qwhilks are meet for the tyme, ordaynes the same first
to be tryit and allowit be the Assemblie.</p>

<p>The Commissioners for the Towne of Edinburgh, viz. John Johnstone
and George Heriot, protestit in the name of the said Towne,
that seeing the Generall Assemblie had ordaynit their ministers
abovenamit to be transportit furth of Edinburgh, the said Towne
sould be free of their burden fra this tyme of their present transportatione,
and that the said transportatione should not be prejudiciall

<p>The Assemblie hes ordainit, that in every Assemblie to be conveint

<p class="p1 center">Sess. 2<sup>a</sup>.</p>

<p>The said day, being callit, Mr George Gladstones, minister at St
Androis, qwha was direct be the last Assemblie to have remainit
for ane quarter or ane half year with the Marques of Huntlie, to
the effect, be his travells and labours, the said Noble Lord and his
family might be informit in the word of truth presently profest
within this realme, and the enemies thereof debarrit from his company,&mdash;to
give an accompt of his diligence done in his said Commission,
the said Mr George compeirand, declared that at the tyme
of his journeying northward for visitatione of the Presbytries of
Cathnes and Sutherland, he addressed himself to the Marques of
Huntly, and remained with him the space of three dayes, dureing
the qwhilk tyme he conferred with him anent the controvertit
heads of religione, and desyred of his Lordship that he wold schaw
him qwherin he doubted, that to the effect be his conferrence he
might be resolvit of such heads thereof as yet he was not fully<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_506"></a>[506]</span>
satisfyit, qwhilk his Lordship promised to doe at his back-coming;
and lykewayes, having demandit why his Lordship’s kirks were
not plantit, and why he resortit not to the preaching at the ordinare
tymes in paroche kirks? To the first he answerit, that the non-planting
of his kirks proceeds upon the not giving licence to the
parsones of the saids kirks to renew his tacks, conforme to the promise
made to his Lordship be the Commissioners of the Assemblie,
at the tyme his Lordship grantit to ane augmentatione of the rent
of the said kirks. As to the second, he could not well resort to
the paroche kirk, partly in respect of the meine rank of such as
were within the paroche, and pairtly in respect his Lordship’s predecessors
were in use to have ane chappell in their awne house,
qwhilk he was myndit to prosecute now, seeing he was presently
prepairing his house of Strathbogie. The said Mr George being
demandit, why he made no longer residence with his Lordship,
conforme to his Commission, answerit, he could not, because the
Marques of Huntlie was upon his voyage southward, at his Majestie’s
directione, for reconciliatione of the feud betwixt him and the
Earle of Murray, qwhilk feud was the cause why his Lordship
could not communicat.</p>

<p>Being callit lykewayes, Mrs Alexander Lyndsay and William
Cowper, Commissioners appoyntit be the last Assemblie to await
upon the Earle of Erroll for the effect forsaid, compearand, Mr
Alexander Lyndsay declareit, that he had awaytit upon the said
Noble Lord dureing his remaining in the Carss of Gowrie, and that
he fand him ane diligent hearer of the word; and having requirit
of him, if he doubtit of anything, his Lordship answerit, that, at
the tyme of his reconciliatione, he did the samen unfainedly, and
had casten all scruples away. As concerning the planting of his
kirks, that he had provyded the samen of his awne benevolence,
and that he wold communicat at such tyme as the samen should be
administrat at any of his awn kirks, whereat his residence should
be for the tyme.</p>

<p>Being callit, Mrs John Spotswood and James Law, Commissioners
appoyntit to await upon the Earle of Angus, Mr John Spottswood
excused himselfe, because he was direct be his Majestie to
awaite upon the Duke of Lennox in his ambassadrie to France, in
respect qwhereof, Mr James Law being appoyntit Commissioner
conjunctly with the said Mr John, could doe nothing him alone;
but because it was reportit be the haill brethren of these parts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_507"></a>[507]</span>
qwher the said Earle does haunt, that he did neither resort to the
hearing of the word, nor participatione of the sacraments, but, be
the contrair, intertaint profest enemies to the religione in his company,
such as Mr Charles Broune; therefore, to advyse in the conferrence
for remead thereof.</p>

<p>Being callit, Mr John Carmichaell, Commissioner appoyntit to
awayt upon my Lord Hoome, declareit, that he execute no part of
his Commission, be reason of the saids Lord’s absence furth of the
countrie. The lyke excuse was usit be Mrs David Lyndsay and
John Hall, qwho were appoyntit for my Lord Herres, in caice he
repairit to Edinburgh, declarit to remaine a schort space in the
said towne.</p>

<p>Anent the Commissioners appoyntit be the last Assemblie to
await upon the constant platt, my Lord Collector being present,
declareit that the stay of that wark proceidit upon the default of
the presbytries, qwho, for the maist part, had neither returnit ane
answer of his Majestie’s letters, direct be his Commissioners, of the
constant platt without the qwhilk they could not proceed, and therefore
the Assembly ordaynes such as had not reportit their answers,
to produce them the morne.</p>

<p>Anent the Commissioners appoyntit for visitatione of presbytries,
the Assemblie ordaynes them to give in their diligence in write the
morne, that the samen may be tryit and considerit be the Assemblie,
and because there hes been slackness, or no executione of such
Commissioners in tyme bygane, be reason of carelessness of such
as were appoyntit to accept the same; Therefore it is ordaynit,
that in tyme comeing, such as shall be appoyntit Commissioners on
them, and promise be their oathes in the face of the Assemblie to
doe their faithfull and honest diligence in the executione thereof,
and to report the same to the next Assemblie, in wreit, under the
paines contained in the acts of the Generall Assemblie, being callit
be the Commissioners of the Generall Assemblie to give accompt
of their proceedings sen the last Assemblie, they were ordaynit to
give in their diligence in write the morne.</p>

<p>The qwhilks things being considerit be the Assemblie, it was
thought most expedient that certaine qualified persones be chosen
out of the ministry, for planting of such parts of the countrie as are
destitute of the word of God, and specially, that qualified men be
chosen out to be appoyntit ministers to the particular families of the
said noblemen, and lykewayes that the cautioners of these that are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_508"></a>[508]</span>
suspect of religion, and were be his Majestie ordayned to pass off
the countrey be straitit, conforme to their bond, and specially for
Patrick Butler, Patrick Mortimer, and wthers, and themselves be
lykewise charged for breaking of the said bond.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sessio 3.</p>

<p>Anent the summonds raisit at the instance of the provinciall of
Lothiane and Tweddall, against Dame Helenor Hay, Countess of
Lithgow, makand mention, That in the proces of excommunicatione
led and deducit against her, be the presbytrie of Lynlithgow,
she had made appellatione from the said presbytrie unto this present
Assemblie, and therefore ordayning her to be summoned to
compeir before this Assemblie, the third day thereof, to prosecute
her appellatione, with certificatione, and schoe failziet, the Assemblie
wald allow of the proces led and deduced against her be the
said presbytrie, as at mair lenth is contained in the saids summonds,
of the date, at Edinburgh, the 3d of Nov. 1602:&mdash;the samen being
callit, the Assemblie continowes the same in the selfe same force
and effect to the morne.</p>

<p>The brethren appoyntit for visitatione of the presbytries in the
last Assemblie qwho were ordaynit this day to produce their diligence
in wreit, being callit, compeirit Mrs David Lyndsay and
John Spottswood, Commissioners for Clydsdaill, Mr Andrew Knox,
for Aire; Mrs James Nicolsone and Robert Harvie, for Fyfe; Mr
Robert Durie, for Orknay; and Mr George Gladstanes, for Cathness;
and producit their diligence in wreit. The rest of the Commissioners
either were not present or had done no diligence:
Qwhilks diligences producit, the Assemblie ordaynit to be visited
be the brethren, Mrs John Hall, Walter Balcanquall, Patrick Walkingshaw,
Archibald Moncreiff, and James Andersone, and thereafter
to report what they have found in it to the haill Assemblie.</p>

<p>The said day, the Commissioners qwho were appoyntit in
the last Assemblie, for planting of burrow townes, vaikand and
waitand upon his Majestie, qwho were ordaynit this day to produce
their diligence and proceedings in wreit, to the effect they
might be tryit be the brethren, and either allowit or disallowit, conforme
as they deserved,&mdash;being callit, they compeirit; and in name
of the rest, Mr James Nicolsone, minister at Meigle, producit their
proceedings in wreit, qwhilk being openly read in presence of the
haill Assemblie, and the brethren being demandit be the Moderator,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_509"></a>[509]</span>
if they had anything to say against the same, or against them
in any other head therefore; after the particular votes of every ane
of the Commissioners was speirit, the Assemblie allowit of the saids
proceedings, and thanked God for the same.</p>

<p>The qwhilk day, the brethren conveint in this present Assemblie,
having considerit nothing is more necessare for the advancement
of God’s glory, and his trew religione within the same,
than that the chieff rowmes and places within the countrey, such as
are noblemen’s houses and families, be plantit with learnit and discreit
pastors, able not only to instruct and confirme the saids noblemen,
their wives, children, and families, in the trew fear of God
and sincere religion presently profest within this realme, but also
qwho may be their provident care and diligence, procure that the
families of such noblemen be not corruptit with the company of
profest Papists, Jesuites, and wthers Seminary Priests, qwho goes
about daily to smore and put out the sparks of trew religione and
knawledge of God kindled in the saids noblemen’s hearts; and because
presently such men cannot be found to undertake the charge
of the said noblemen’s families, as said is, Therefore, the Assemblie
hes thought good, that for a tyme, brethren meitest for the purpose
sould be borrowit from their awne places, to remaine for the space
of ane quarter of ane year, continwally with the saids noblemen, be
qwhais labours in the meantyme, qwhill ane constant and permanent
provisione may be found out for planting of these roumes, the
saids noblemen and their families may be confirmit in the truth, and
the enemies thereof debarrit from their companies, and thereafter to
returne to their awne charges: And in the meantyme, that the
presbytries take order that their places be furnischit dureing their
absence, and therefore they have elect and nominat the brethren
following, to await upon the saids noblemen dureing the space foresaid,
viz. Mrs William Scott, minister at Kennaqwhy, to remaine
with the Marquess of Huntlie; for the Earle of Erroll, Mr Alexander
Lyndsay; for the Earle of Angus, Mr James Law; for the
Laird Hoome, Mr James Carmichaell; for the Laird Maxwell,
so long as he remaynes in the Castle of Edinburgh, Mr Henry
Blyth; for the Lord Heres, Mr Robert Wallace; for the Lord
Semple, the Presbytery of Irvine, during his residence within the
same; and in caice he remaine within the Presbytrie of Paisley,
the said Presbytrie to awayte upon him: and lykewyse for the
Earle of Sutherland, the Presbytrie of Edinburgh, because he makes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_510"></a>[510]</span>
residence within the same: And in caice any of the noblemen make
their residence any tyme in Edinburgh, or within the Presbytrie
thereof, the Assemblie ordaynes the Presbytrie of Edinburgh to
direct two brethren of their number, with the like power as the
brethren above specifeit, to awayte upon every ane of the saids
noblemen that shall be found resident within their Presbytries;
qwhilks brethren forsaid, and every ane of them, shall receive the
articles in wreit frae this Assemblie, wherein they shall travell with
the saids noblemen; qwhilk articles the Assemblie ordaynes to be
pennit be Mrs James Melvill, James Nicolsone, Patrick Galloway,
William Scott, and Alex<sup>r</sup> Lyndsay, to be given in the morne
to the Assemblie, that the brether may consider the same, the tenor
qwherof follows:</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>Instructiones for the Brethren appoyntit be the General Assemblie
to attend upon the Noblemen above specifeit.</p>
</div>

<p>1. First, ye shall adress yourselves with all convenient diligence
and necessar furniture to enter in the companie and families, and
there to remaine still with them for the space of three moneths continuall,
dureing the qwhilk tyme your principall care shall be publick
doctrine, by reading and interpretatione of the Scriptures ordinarly
at their tables, and by conferrence at all meit occasions, to
instruct them in the haill grounds of trew religione and godliness,
speciallie in the heads controvertit, and confirme them therein.</p>

<p>2. Take paines to catechise the families ordinarly every day,
ance or twyce at the leist, or so oft as may serve to bring them to
some reasonable measure of knowledge and feilling of religione,
before the expyring of the tyme prescryvit for your remaining there,
and let this action begin and end with prayer.</p>

<p>3. Preass to have their houses purgit of all persons living inordinatly,
qwhais ill example might be a sclander to their professione,
specially such as are of suspect religione, and found any wayes
bussie in traffiqueing against the truth and quietness of the estate
of the countrey, and be carefull to hold all such persones forth of
their houses and company.</p>

<p>4. Travell to have the kirks plantit with sufficient provision of
stipends and well qualified persones, and procure that be authoritie
and assistance, the discipline of the kirk may have execution within
their bounds.</p>

<p>5. Persuade them to make honest provisione of stipends for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_511"></a>[511]</span>
intertainment of resident pastors at their houses and chiefe dwelling-places,
and to make choice of learnit, grave, and wyse pastors, to
be plantit thereat.</p>

<p>6. Wrge the performance of the articles agriet upon and subscrivit
at the tyme of their reconciliatione, and registrat in the books
of the Assemblie, qwherout of ye shall extract them.</p>

<p>7. Informe the King’s Majestie from tyme to tyme how they have
profited, and what company resortes to them, and qwhat dispositione
their company is of.</p>

<p>Qwhilks articles being read in audience of the Assemblie, the
brethren approvit the same, and ordaynit them to be insert, with
the commission given to the ministers appoyntit to remaine with
the saids Lords, in the books of the Assemblie.</p>

<p>The brethren appoyntit to visite the diligence of the visitors appoyntit
in the last Assemblie, finds fault that in all their diligences
producit, except of Caithnes and of Fyfe, the visitors hes not exactly
tryit the lyfe, doctrine, and conversations of every minister at
his awne kirk and be his awne flock, but nakedly and slenderly by
a generall view of the Synodall Assemblie, qwhilk the Assemblie
finds fault with, and ordayns it to be mendit in tyme coming.</p>

<p>The qwhilk day the brethren conveint, having ryplie weyit how
necessar it is that ane generall visitatione be for inquyrand in the
life, doctrine, and conversatione of every ane of the ministry in particular,
the qwhilk, albeit it was committit to the charge of visitors
appoyntit to the last Assemblie, nevertheless they, at the leist the
maist of them, hes done small or no diligence in the executione of
that profitable wark committit to their charge, excusit partly be
infirmitie and sickness, and partly be wther necessar effaires qwherein
they were imployit as they alleadgit: Therefore the Assemblie, not
willing that such a necessar and profitable wark sould want their
awne good execution, hes nominate, and be thir presents nominats
the brethren following their very lawfull Commissioners, for visitatione
of the bounds underwritten, every ane of them for their awne
parts as they are particularly designit, viz., for Orkney, Mr Robert
Pont; for Caithnes and Sutherland, Mr George Gladstones, Mr

for Merss and Teviotdale, Mrs John Carmichaell and James
Law; for Clydsdaill, Mrs John Spottiswood, William Arthure;
for Aire and Irving, Mrs Andrew Boyd, John Hay; for Nithsdale
and Annandale, Mrs John Knox, Patrick Schaw, John
Smith; for Galloway, Mrs John Welsche, Hew Fullertone; for
Argyle, Mrs Andrew Knox, Andrew Lambe: Givand, grantand,
and committand unto them conjunctlie, and in caice of sickness of
any ane of them, with power to the wther, &amp;c., to try the brethren
of the ministry within the bounds particularlie committit to every
ane of their charges respective, in their lyfe, doctrine, qualificatione,
and conversatione, and how they behave themselves touching the
rents of their benefices, qwhether they haue sett tacks of the samen,
but consent of the Generall Assemblie or not, and so incurrit the
sentence of dilapidatione; with power, also, to try the Presbytries
within their visitationes, if they have keepit their ordinarie conventiones
and particular visitationes of their awne kirks, and wsit
and exercisit all things as pertaines to the Presbytrie; with power,
also, to them to try every particular congregatione within the
bounds committed to their visitatione, and generally, to try every
ane of the ministers, presbytry, and congregatione, conforme to the
particular order of visitatione sett down in this Assemblie; and in
caice any fault or enormity be found be them in any of the saids
visitationes committit to them, with power to censure the same according
to the act of the Generall Assemblie; and as they proceed
in their said visitatione, that they report their haill proces and
diligence to the next General Assemblie, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">promitten de rato</i>.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sess. 4<sup>a</sup>.</p>

<p>The said day it being considerit be the Assemblie, that for inlaike
of ane constant and uniforme order of visitatione of synods, presbytries,
and particular kirks, the labours and travells taken hitherto
hes been almost unprofitable, Therefore, that ane solide order may
be generallie observit in visitationes in all tyme coming throughout
the haill kirks within this realme, the Assemblie ordaynes the
brethren following, viz., Mrs Robert Pont, Patrick Galloway,
James Carmichael, William Scott, and Alex<sup>r</sup>. Lyndsay, to advyse
anent the subject of visitationes, and they forme ane order of proces
that shall be wsit in the same in all tyme coming, and to produce
the same in wreit to the Assemblie the morne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_513"></a>[513]</span></p>

<p>The qwhilk day the brethren having considerit the great travells
and paines taken in [be] their brother, Mr John Howisone, in answering
to Bellarmine in three sundrie volumes, and how profitable
the same will be to the kirk of God, qwhilk he presentit to the Assemblie,
desyring the same to be revysit be them, to the effect, if
they be found worthy, they may be put forth in print, they appoyntit
the said wark to be revisit by Mr Robert Howie, James Nicolsone,
and James Robertsone; thereafter be Mr Andrew Melvill; and last,
be Mrs Robert Pont and John Hall, and to report to the next
Assemblie; qwhilks books are presently delyverit to Mr Robert
Howie.</p>

<p>Anent the constant platt, the brether appoyntit to sitt thereupon
with his Majestie’s Commissioners being demandit, qwhat effect
their travells had taken in the same? they producit the conclusione
of the commissioners of the said platt, resolving in three heads, out
of the qwhilk ane should be chosen, as the most ready way for
effectuating the said wark, qwhereof the tenor follows:</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>Overtures of the Commissioners of the Plat to be devysit
with his Majestie.</p>
</div>

<p>If every minister’s stipends being assigned out of the fruits of the
kirk qwhere he serves be the benevolence of the tacksmen, that they
shall grant to the augmentation of the said stipend? If there shall
be ane perpetuall securitie made be the saids tacksmen of their
teinds upone ane speciall grissome, to be condescendit upon for ilk
chalder, for the space of nynteine yeares, to be renewit yearly thereafter
for the said space for the lyke grissome, upon this conditione,
that the said principall tacksmen shall grant and renew the lyke
securitie to their sub-tacksmen, for payment of their part of the
said grissume <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro rata</i>, qwhere any sub-tacks are? Or if the great
benefices shall be provydit to ministers upon this conditione, that
all the kirks of the prelacies be plantit with sufficient ministers, and
be provydit with competent livings, as the modifiers of the constant
platt shall think expedient, and he to pay to the King’s Majestie
yearly the tent-part of the fruits of the said benefice qwhilk shall
rest, by and attour the sustentatione of the ministry, and that all
the inferior benefices shall be provydit to ministers serving the cure
of the saids kirks, alse well parsonages as vicarages? Or if all the
great benefices shall be dissolvit, and the prelate to have the principall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_514"></a>[514]</span>

<p>Qwhilks overtures being read in presence of the Assemblie, it
was ordayned that every synod should have ane copie of them to
be advysit therewith, until the morne, that they might give their
advyce to his Majestie, qwhilk of [the] three were maist meet to

<p>2. That ministers are callit before his Hienes’ Secret Council, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in

in the hands of a few number, under the name of a Commission,
to the prejudice of the liberties of the Synods and Presbytries.</p>

<p>5. That the Doctors beiring ordinar calling in the Kirk, be
the discipline and custome thereof, are debarrit from the Assemblies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_515"></a>[515]</span></p>

<p>6. That the Assemblie hes taken no tryall, hithertill, anent the
cautiones sett downe for avoyding of corruption in the Commissioners’
votes in Parliament.</p>

<p>7. That the absence of the pastors of Edinburgh, alteratione of
the ministry thereof, qwhilk was the chief watch-tower of our
kirks, hurts greatly the cause of religion and encourages the enemies.</p>

<p>8. That there is distractione in opiniones different from that
consent of hearts, qwhilk hes been in the Kirk before, in weighty
causes, and over little consideratione, deliberatione, and reasonyng
had, qwherby conclusions pass, almost the halfe of the brethren
gainsaying.</p>

<p>9. That the land is defylit, and the Kirk indamnadgit, be the

to the watchmen, whereby they may make the faithfull warning,

for eschewing of civill punischment.</p>

<p>14. That the remedies sett downe againes apprehendit dangers
at diverse tymes, and at diverse meetings of the Kirk, are not followit
furth.</p>

<p>Anent the act made of before, against such persones as abstaines
from the holy communione, either for Papistrie or collour of deidly
feuds, The Assemblie ordayns that every ane of the ministry keep
this order following within this Kirk, to witt, That he warne such
persones be the space of <span class="transnote nowrap">{blank space}</span> moneths before the communione
to compeir themselves for the samen, qwhilk beand done, and they
disobeyand, that every minister incontinent thereafter, send the
names of the disobeyers subscrybit with his hand to ane of the
King’s Majestie’s ministers, qwha shall intimate the same to his
Majestie and his Hienes’ Thesaurer, to the effect that his Majestie’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_516"></a>[516]</span>
Thesaurer may put the acts made against non-communicants to
executione against them, and that every presbytrie command the
ministers within their presbytrie to be diligent in the executione of
this act.</p>

<p>Because it was meint be the brethren, that the supplicatione made
in the last Assemblie to his Majestie anent the restrayning of noble
and gentlemen’s sonnes, that passes furth of the countrey to such
places qwher there is restrainit of the trew religion, Therefore his

give ane command to the Secretar that he sould subscryve no warrant
for passing of noble or gentlemen’s sonnes furth of the country,
except they first fand cautione conform to the tenor of the act
made in the last Assemblie anent passing of gentlemen’s sonnes
furth of the country.</p>

<p>The said day, the King’s Majestie having declareit that it was
requisite that his Hienes had ane wther minister adjoynit unto his
house, to the effect his Prince might be brought up in the trew religione,
Therefore the Assemblie transports Mr James Nicolsone
from the kirk of Meagle, and appoynts him to be minister at his
Majestie’s house, to the effect foresaid, and ordaynes him to enter
in the said functione betwixt and the 15th day of February nixt to
come, under the paine of deprivatione, provyding he be first sufficiently
provydit be his Majestie; and lykewayes ordaynes Mr Andrew
Lambe to enter to his cure in his Majestie’s house, betwixt

and George Herriot, Commissioners for the said towne, being
callit, declarit that for the present they had but three kirks, qwhilk
already were plantit with sax ministers, and qwhen as their fourth
kirk, qwhilk is presently bigging, is compleit, they would crave

<p class="p1 center">Answers to the Petitiones of the Synod of Fyffe.</p>

<p>1. Finds that the Generall Assemblie should be appoyntit to be

Assemblies appoyntit be the said Kirk, and declares that it shall be

therby.</p>

<p>3. Thinks it expedient that the Act anent the applicatione in the
exercise be interpret not to forbid the wseing of the word of God
in applicatione to the generall ends thereof, qwhilk is lawfull to
exercise after this manner. This head of doctrine serves for refutatione
of such ane error, for the rebuke of such ane vyce, for comforting
of a person or people in such a case; and as for particular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_520"></a>[520]</span>
and personall applicationes, leaves it to be advysit qwhither it shall
be in tyme coming or not, and how far any thinks good that this

1581, qwher it is found and declareit be the act of the Generall
Assemblie, that doctors should concurr with the elders as brethren

schaw the same to the Assemblie, and how the Presbytrie of Edinburgh
is satisfyit in this poynt.</p>

Halkerstoune, Patrick Butler, Mr Alex. Leslie, Duncane Law,
Thomas Browne, William Leslie, Patrick Mortimer.</p>

<p>9. Endit in the Assemblie.</p>

<p>10. To acquiesce in his Majestie’s declaratione hereanent, and
requests his Majestie that the Presbytries be acquainted hereafter,
in such case qwher it shall be needfull.</p>

<p>11. Where there is negligence in this poynt, let it be amendit

<p>The said day, the Assemblie, considering that the conventiones
of the people, especiallie on the Sabbath day, are very rare in many
places, be distractione of labour, not only in harvest and seed-tyme,
but also euery Sabbath, be fisching both of whyte fische and salmond
fisching, and in ganging of milnes of all sorts on the Sabbath
day, under the payne of incurring the censures of the Kirk, and
ordaynes the Commissioners of this present Assemblie, to meine
the same to his Majestie, and to desyre that ane pecuniall paine
might be injoynit upon the contraveiners of this present act.</p>

<p>Anent the overtures giuen in be the Commissioners of the
constant platt, with the qwhilk the brethren were ordaynit to be
advysit: after mature deliberatione and voteing, the Assemblie
thinks the second overture most expedient to be acceptit, bearing
the provisione of ministers to all prelacies, with the conditiones
therein contenit, as is above exprest.</p>

<p>Anent the planting of the kirks within the bounds of Annandale,
qwhilks hes been desolate continually, sen the reformatione of religione

was myndet to cause the barrones and gentlemen of Annandale,
at their compeiring before his Hienes, qwhilk will be schortly, find
sufficient cautione and seurtie for provisione of reasonable and competent
livings to every ane of the kirks within the bounds of Annandale,
and therefore desyrand that ane number of qualified men
may be provydit for to enter in the ministry at the kirks within the
saids bounds.</p>

<p>The Assembly ordaynes every ane of the Commissioners present
to give in the names of such persones qwho are vaikand within
their presbytries, and willing to enter in the ministry, to the effect
they may be exhortit and earnestly dealt with be the Commissioners
of the Generall Assemblie, qwho shall plant them in places they
think maist meet, for to accept upon them the cure of the saids
kirks, how soone sufficient provisione may be found out for them,
and security for themselves; and in caice that after all the discretione
be wsit with them, they then refuse to accept the saids callings
upon them, the Assemblie declares that they shall be counted
incapable of the functione of the ministry, ay and qwhill they meine
themselves to the saids Commissioners, qwhais calling and directione
they refuised, and be content to be employit in any part
qwher they shall think expedient; and in caice they be already actuall
ministers, and crave transportatione, if they refuse to be
transportit to any of the saids vaikand kirks, the Assembly finds
that the liberty of transportatione sall be denyit unto them, so that
they shall remaine at the saids kirks, from the qwhilks they crave

of the said towne, makand mentione, that qwhere [be] the
transportatione of Mr Hew Fullertone, sometyme minister at their
said kirk, the estate of their congregatione is altogether desolate in
such sort, that for inlaike of ane pastor qwho should attend upon their
flock, and to caire the weill of their soules, they are not only depryvit
of the spirituall food and comfort of the word, but also their
towne is become ane seat of excommunicat Papists and Jesuites;
desyrand therfor this Assemblie to consider their miserable estate,
and to provyde some qualified men to be their pastor; and in speciall,
ane of the leits given in be them, viz. Mrs David Barclay,
Wm. Arthure, Alex. Scrymgeour, Wm. Watsone, or Hew Fullartone;

<p>The said day it was thocht good be the brethren, to be meinit,
that notwithstanding his Majestie’s good meaning and intention to

with competent livings appoyntit for them, and albeit it was
provydit be the act of Februar, and approvit in Parliament, that all
the thirds of the benefices sould be applyit to the wse of the ministry
ay and qwhill the kirks were plantit, and that, pensiones given
in prejudice thereof should be null, yet be importune suiting, ane
great part of the saids thrids are disponit in pensione, to the great
hinderance not only of the present provisione of the ministry, but
also of the constant platt qwhilk his Majestic intends; desyrand
therefore that his Majestie were informit thereof, and tak such order
that the saids dispositiones made in contrair the said act of
Februar should be retreatit, and that command sould be given to
the modifiers of the platt of this instant year, to assigne out of the

<p>Anent the request made be the moderator, in name of the haill
Assemblie, to his Majestie, in favours of Mr Robert Bruce: his Majestie
declarit that he wold doe in that matter be the advyce of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_525"></a>[525]</span>Commissioners of the Generall Assemblie, and Mr Rob<sup>t</sup>. be his
awne behaviour should give him occasione; and because Mr Ro<sup>t</sup>.
Bruce had be his missive direct to his Majestie before his departure
off the countrie, as also by the ratificatione and farther
examinatione and explanatione thereof, in write, at Perth, the 26th
of July 1602, declareit his resolutione of his Majestie’s innocencie,
and guiltiness of the Earl of Gowrie and his brother, and promised
to direct the people so farr as in him lay, from their lewd opinions
and uncharitable constructiones anent his Majestie’s actiones, namely,
in this turne; Therefore, his Majestie desyrit the determinatione
of the Assemblie, qwhither, if the said Mr Robert sould likewise
make the same declaratione in pulpit, according as it is at lenth sett
downe in the said missive and explanation thereof, at Perth, qwherof
the tenor follows:</p>

<p>Please your Majestie: Hearing that your Majestie was nothing
relentit of your wrath against me, and now being upon the poynt
to schaw my obedience to your Majestie’s last charge, I could not
omitt this as my last dewtie, to intreat your Hienes’ clemencie, and
to mitigat the extremetie of this intendit wrath. I am not ignorant
that the wrath of the Prince is the messenger of death; so that I
crave that the Lord for Christ’s sake may add his blessing and
work effectually in your Grace, as he shall see expedient for his
own glory and your Majestie’s perpetuall preservatione. Then to
be schort: To schaw my conformitie with the rest of my brether
of the ministry, as at all tymes, so now especially, to schaw my reverence
to your Majestie, and to clear my suspectit affections herein,
I offer to give to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, in him,
and through him, most hearty thanks for all your Majestie’s deliveries,
from your cradle to this present houre. But namely, for that
deliverie qwhilk he delyverit to your Majestie, in St Johnstoune,
on Tuesday the 5th of August, farr above all your Majestie’s deserts,
and your Majestie’s expectation. I offer also to steir vp the
people to that same dewtie, and attour to divert the people so farr
as in me lyes, from their lewd opiniones, and uncharitable constructiones
of your Majestie’s actions,&mdash;namely in this turne. <em>Finallie</em>,
there is no dewtie that your Majestie can crave of men, without the
manifest offence of God, and hurt of my own conscience, but I will
doe it with alse good ane heart as ever I did thing in the earth:
That if by any meanes I might testify my good affectione toward
your Majestie my Sovereigne, and to enjoy my naturall air, and
such wther comforts as the Lord hes given me under your Majestie’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_526"></a>[526]</span>
reign, qwhilk I most humbly crave of your Majestie&mdash;beseekand
the Lord to move your heart hereunto for Christ’s sake: So
waiting of your Heines’ answer in all humility, I take my leave.&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sic
subscribitur.</i></p>

<p class="right">Mr <span class="smcap">Rob<sup>t</sup>. Bruce</span>.</p>

<p>And upon the back thereof, “At Perth, the 26th of June 1600.
Farther, concerning the heids within containit, I am resolvit of his
Majestie’s innocencie, and the guiltiness of the Earle of Gowrie and
his brother, according as it is declareit be the act of Parliament,
and therefore acknowledges the great mercy of God towards his
Majestie’s haill Kirk and countrie; in his Majestie’s delyverance,
for the qwhilk I thank God from my heart.&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sic subscribitur.</i></p>

<p class="right">Mr <span class="smcap">Ro<sup>t</sup>. Bruce</span>.”</p>

<p>The qwhilk, the haill Assemblie, after voteing, thought not
onlie reasonable, but also concludes that the said Mr Robert aucht
to doe the same.</p>

<p>Anent the supplicatione given in be Mr Robert Pont, minister at
St Cuthbert’s Kirk, desyrand, in respect of his great age, and long
travells taken in the Kirk of God, and continwall seikness qwhilk
followeth age, that he might be relieved from the ordinare burden
of teaching, upon condition that he shall substitute ane in his place
when as through infirmitie he sould not be able to teach himself:
The Assemblie thinks his sute reasonable, and therefore condescendit
unto the same.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, Because his Majestie declarit that he was informit that
sundry of the ministrie neglectit that part of their duty towards his
Majestie in not giving thanks to God for the wonderfull delivery
of his Majestie from the treasonable attempt at St Johnstone of
sometyme John Earle of Gowrie, and his brother, upon every fifth
day of August: Therefore the Assemblie statutes and ordaines that
in all burrow townes within this realme there be ordinar teaching
and preaching every Tuesday, in remembrance of the delyverie
of his Majestie that day of the week, and that every fyfth day of
August there be preaching within every paroche kirk within this
realme, to burgh and land, thankand God of his Majestie’s delyverance
that day of the moneth; and because the people in landwart
parochines cannot so easilie be conveint as in the burrow townes,
therefore, and for better convening, it is ordainit that every minister<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_527"></a>[527]</span>
at the landwart kirk shall, upon the Sunday preceding the 5 of
August, make intimatione to his parochiners to convene the said
day in the kirk with him, to give God thanks for his Majestie’s delyverance.
And to the effect that all ryotousness, drunkenness, and
wther filthie exercises, may be restrainit, his Majestie promised to
cause all insolencie in behaviour to be dischargit and forbidden
yearly, be open proclamatione, and magistrats to take order with
the contraveiners thereof.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, The Assemblie ordaynes that no marriages be celebrate
early in the morning or with candlelight, and finds lykewayes that
it is leisum to celebrate the said band of marriage upon the Sabbath
day, or any wther preaching day, as the pairties shall requyre and
think expedient: and ordaynes the same to be indifferently done,
and that no ryotousness be used at the same upon the Sabbath day.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, It is statute that the sacrament of baptisme be not refusit
to any infants if the parents crave the same, he givand ane Christian
confession of his faith, upon any wther particular pretence, and
specially, that baptisme be not delayit to certaine particular dayes.</p>

<p>Anent the supplicatione given in be Mr Edward Bruce, Abbot
of Kynloss, makand mention, that qwher he havand ane tacke and
assedatione of the kirk of Tarbet, sett be Mr John Monro, and lykewayes
be Mr David Lyndsay, Bishop of Ross, the yearly dewtie
qwherof, albeit it extends only to the soume of two hundreth
punds, neverthelesse he, for the better intertainment of the actuall
minister at the said kirk, hes condescendit to convert the said soume
of twa hundreth punds in twa chalders of bier for ane constant stipend
to the said minister and his successors, ministers at the said
kirk of Tarbett, upon conditione that the ministers of the Presbytrie
of Rosse, qwhilks are of the chapiter of the said bishoprick,
wald ratifie and approve this tack of the said kirk, qwhilk they
wald willingly doe, provyding the Assemblie’s consent were obtainit
thereto, as at mair lenth is contained in the said supplicatione:
The Generall Assemblie ratifies and approves the said tack and assedatione,
sett to the said commendator of the said kirk of Tarbett,
alse weill be the said Mr John Monro as be the said Mr David
Lyndsay, and ordaynes the brethren of the presbytrie of Ross, qwho
are members of the said chapter, to consent to the same be their
subscriptiones, because they understand the said kirk to be sufficiently
plantit be the moyen forsaid.</p>

<p>Anent the supplicatione given in be Mr Patrick Carmichaell, minister<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_528"></a>[528]</span>
at Aberdour, makand mention, that qwher the Assembly
halden at Montrose in Marche 1600 years, it was concludit that Mr
William Patone should serve the cure of both the kirks of Aberdour
and Dalgatie, and for his service sould uplift the old stipend
of baith the saids kirks, ay and qwhill sufficient provisione be made
for planting of both the saids kirks; and trew it is that the said
complainer is now plantit minister at the said kirk of Aberdour, desyrand,
therefore, to cause the half of the said stipend to be dimittit
to him be the said Mr William in respect of his service at ane of
the saids kirks: The Assemblie finds and decerns the haill stipend
controvertit, to pertaine to Mr W<sup>m</sup>. Patone, minister at Dalgatie,
conforme to his assignatione of the cropt 1601, except the viccarage
of Aberdour, qwhilk they adjudge to pertaine to the said minister
of Aberdour.</p>

<p>Anent the supplicatione in the north paroche of Leith, makand
mention, that qwher the Presbytrie of Edinburgh hes erected the
said north paroche in ane parochine, qwhilk is also approvine be
the Synod of Lowthiane, desyrand, therefore, the ratificatione of
the Generall Assemblie unto the same: The Assemblie ratifies and
approves the erectione of the same in all poynts.</p>

<p>Anent the supplicatione giuen in be the inhabitants of the ferrie
of Scottscraig, Garpat, Shannwell, and Muirtaine, makand mention,
That they being a great multitude, and farr distant from their paroche
kirk of Leuchars, they, with common consent of the haill parochiners,
Presbytrie of St Androis, and Synod of Fyffe, had erectit ane
paroche kirk in the said Ferrie, and almost compleited the same,
for the commoditie and use of the people most adjacent thereto,
and to give power to the Presbytrie to annex sic villages as are
most adjacent to the said paroch kirk: The Assemblie ratifies the
erectione forsaid, and gives power to the said Presbytrie to the
effect above written.</p>

<p>Anent the supplicatione giuen in be ane Noble Lord, Alexander
Earle of Lynlithgow, makand mentione, That qwher it hes pleasit
the brethren of the last Assemblie to relax Dame Helenor Hay,
his spouse, from the sentence of excommunicatione, and to injoyne
certaine particular conditiones to be observit be hir, qwhilks conditiones,
albeit schoe, of the stubbornness of her heart, wold no
wayes condescend unto, to his great grief and sorrow, nevertheless,
the brethren sould have consideratione of his hard estate, who
cannot, be no law, separate himself from her, notwithstanding that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_529"></a>[529]</span>
schoe refuises to hear and obey the wholsome voyce of the Kirk,
calling her to grace in Jesus Christ; and that the rather because
he himself, as he hes continuallie and constantly profest the truth
and religione presently profest within this realme, so he hes used
all means possible to bring his house to the trew knawledge of the
same; Lykeas also he is ready in his power, be all good meanes to
draw her to the truth; desyrand, therefore, the Assemblie to pity
his dayly grief, and schaw him some favour in the mitigatione of
her punishment, and staying of the censure of excommunicatione
against her, that he be not compellit to remaine in societie with
her that shall be cutt off from the society of the Kirk: The Assemblie
having considerit the supplicatione, continows the sentence of
excommunicatione against her unto the nixt Generall Assemblie,
provyding that the King’s Majestie remove his Hienes daughter out
of her companie, and lykewise that his Lordship’s bairnes be catechised
in the truth, and that his Majestie give command to him to
debarre all Papists from his house, and that in the meantyme his
Lordship cause deall with his said spouse, to sie if by any meanes
she may be drawne to the knawledgeing of the truth.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sessio Ultima.</p>

<p>Anent the supplicatione giuen in be the brethren of the Synod
of Glasgow, makand mention, That qwher albeit syndrie tymes
they had discharged, be their acts, Mr George Symple, to have any
medling with the ministry of the kirk of Killelane, for the causes
and considerationes knawn to them, and speciallie for a great myslyking
that specialls of the paroche had of him, nevertheless, he not
only insistit in suiting of the said kirk, but also had obtaynit, be
privie moyen, the consent of the Commissioners of the Generall
Assemblie thereto, for planting of him at the said kirk, the saids
brethren not being heard, nor their reasons in the contrair discusst,
desyreing therefore their reasons to be heard, and after dew tryall,
that the Assemblie wald give their finall sentence in the said matter,
qwhilk they would obey: The Assemblie, after dew tryall,
absolves the said Mr George from all evill crymes and eylists
qwhilk were laid to his charge, either be the brethren of the said
province, or be the parochiners of Killelane, and gives him, be thir
presents, ane testimony of his honest behaviour; but in respect he
was never fully plantit minister at the said kirk, and of the great
mislyking that is betwixt him and sundrie of the saids parochiners<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_530"></a>[530]</span>
of Killelane, as said is, they think it not good that he be plantit
minister at the said kirk, and therefore ordaynes him to desist therfrae,
and dimitt the presentatione made to him of the benefice thereof
in favours of Mr John Cunninghame, qwham the Presbytrie hes
thought good to be minister at the said kirk, upon conditione that
the said Mr George be first satisfyit be the said Mr John for his
said dimissione, paines and loss, susteinit be him in pleying of the
same: Qwhilk satisfactione shall be presently modified be Mr John
Cowper, arbiter chosen for the said Mr John Cunninghame, and
Mr Robert Pont, arbiter chosen for the said Mr George Simple,
and, in caice of variance, be Mr Patrick Galloway, as odsman and
oversman chosen be both their consents: with provisione lykwayes
that the said Mr George be first plantit at the kirk of Kirkbeane,
or any uther place qwher his Majestie shall think expedient in the
south-west parts, with sufficient provisione for his sustentatione
thereat.</p>

<p>The said day, the Assemblie ordaynes Richard Browne to be
transportit to the kirk of Holywood, and that the brethren deall
with the Abbot for ane sufficient provisione to the said kirk, and
in speciall Mr David Barclay, Mr Robert Hunter, and Mr Hew
Fullertoune.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, The Assemblie ordaynes that, in all tyme coming, the
licence be grantit to any beneficit persone to sett tacks, be restraint
aither to ane lyferent tack, or to ane nynetein year tack allanarly.</p>

<p>Anent the supplicatione given in be Mr John Nicolsone of Lesswade,
beirand, that qwher he was kindlie tacksman of the teinds of
his awne lands of Leswade, in respect qwherof he had agreit with
Mr George Ramsay, Deane of Restalrig, for renewing of his said
tacks for payment of ane greater dewtie then they payit of before,
so that the Kirk was sufficiently plantit, to the qwhilks the said
Mr George condescendit, desyrand, therefore, the Assemblie to ratifie
and approve the saids tacks, and declare the same alse sufficient
as if ane speciall licence had been obtained thereto: The Assemblie
ratifies and approves the same taks of the teinds of his awn
lands of Lesswaid, and declares the samen als sufficient, as if a
speciall licence had been obtenit therto.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, At the earnest sute of the Presbytrie of Clyddisdaill, Walter,
Prior of Blantyre, tacksman of the personage of Glasgow, had condescendit
to give the number of 15 chalder victuall, by and attour
the dewtie of his tacks, for the better provisione of the ministrie at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_531"></a>[531]</span>
the said kirk of Glasgow, upon conditione that the present persone
sould ratifie and approve his present tack that he hes to runne of
the said teinds: The Assemblie thinks the conditione reasonable,
and therefore ordaynes the persone to ratifie the same, and declares
that the said Commendator shall not be farther troublit for any
great provisione to the said kirk during his saids tacks, be nane of
the ministry serving that cure.</p>

<p>Anent the propositione made in the Assemblie upon the priuat
motiones of sundry particular brethren, from diverse parts to the
Moderator, desyrand that a certaine number of the brethren of best
judgement and experience should be put apart to consider of the
chiefest dangers appeirand to the estate of religion and quyetness of
the countrie, and of the principall causes thereof, and how the samen
micht be most effectuallie preventit, with power to them to conclude
and to communicat their best advyces to his Majestie thereanent,
and to the Presbytries so far as shall be found expedient: The Assemblie
finds the samen most requisite, and for the effect above-written,
nominats, &amp;c. with power, as said is.</p>

<p>The qwhilk brethren having at lenth communicat their informatione,
together with their awne knawledge anent the premisses,
Finds that ane of the chiefest causes of danger proceeds from the
miscontentment of some malicious and wicked Papists, that rages
and leaves nothing unessayit to trouble; for being out of all esperance
to have his Majestie’s indifferent affection or oversight toward
them and their religion during his reigne, and of others that be the
executione of justice finds themselves or their friends and their
houses to have sustainit any losse, and to be impairit of their grytest
dependance, and redacted to live under the obedience of the
lawes utherwayes nor they were wont, and from the malicious
business of certaine craftie and seditious persones, that either for
the present necessitie of their awne estate, or for the hope of advancement
of gaine to be had in the change of the present goverment,
ceases not be all meanes to inflame the hearts of such as they
perceive to be miscontentit in any estate, and making every man to
see his own desyre in the trouble of the countrey, dealing in the
meantyme likewayes with such as are of the most sincere affectione
to Religion and Justice; That things is not done of that integrity
that is profest, pressing to make the godly and good subjects the
more cold, and adversaries to such as would intend a trouble: ffor
remead qwhereof it is thocht good and concludit, That his Majestie<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_532"></a>[532]</span>
shall be informit hereanent, that be his awne care and foresight such
ungodly plots and counsells may be frustrate, and suchlyke that
every minister within this realme shall deall generally with their
congregationes and auditors at all occasiones in their publick doctrine
in pulpit, and with all noblemen, barrones, gentlemen, and
uthers that are of any speciall credite or power, particularlie in their
private conferrences, persuading them of the King’s honest mynd
toward the establisching of the trew religione presently profest within
this countrie, and the executione of justice, and of his stedfast
resolutione to hazard his estate, lyfe, and crowne, in the cause
of the gospell, with the standing and falling qwhereof he acknowledges
his standing and falling to be inseparably conjoynit, and
that they mark carefully the actiones of all men, especially of
such as either for religione or executione of justice, or for the
necessitie of their awne estate, mislykes the present government,
and are inclynit unto novations, and qwhom they see in any extraordinar
kinde of bussiness by their custome, and that they
make his Majestie’s Ministers acquaintit therwith, not ceasing in
the meantyme to bring them to ane quiet minde; and for this
effect that in all their ordinary meetings in Sessions, Presbytries,
and provinciall Assemblies, there be a particular and private
inquisition in thir poynts as need beis, that his Majestie’s Ministers
may be advertised with all expeditione: And lykewayes it is thought
expedient and concludit that his Majestie’s Ministers, and such
uthers of the ministrie as shall have occasione to be in any charge
about his Majestie, informe the Presbytries of the estate of things
as they proceed, so far as it is needfull for the weill of the cause,
and that this advyce be extractit and sent with diligence to every
Presbytrie in authentick forme.</p>

<p>The nixt Assemblie is appoyntit to be halden at Aberdeene, the
last Twesday of July in the year of God 1604 years.</p>

<p>Thanks beand given to God be the Moderator for the comfortable
successe of this present Assemblie, the brethrene were dismissed.</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p class="p2">We have now completed the record of all the General Assemblies of the Church
of Scotland, held in and betwixt the years 1560 and 1602 inclusive. The Acts
of these Assemblies constitute all that are regarded as authoritative by the Presbyterian
Church. There were Assemblies, indeed, in the years 1606, 1608,
1610, 1616, 1617, and 1618; but the General Assembly of Glasgow, held in
the year 1638, decreed “every ane of them to have been, from the beginning,
unfree, unlawfull, and null Assemblies, and never to have had, nor hereafter to
have, any Ecclesiasticall authoritie, and their conclusions to have been and to bee
of no force, vigor, nor efficacie; prohibited all defence and observance of them,
and ordained the reasons of their nullitie to be insert in the Books of Assembly.”<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
And in the Assembly of 1639 it was also declared, that the proceedings of these
Assemblies “be hereafter accompted as null and of none effect.”<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The Acts of
those Assemblies thus repudiated, have ever since been regarded by the Church as
of no authority. As, however, the proceedings in five of those Assemblies are
contained in the MS. copies of the “Booke of the Kirk” to which we have had
access, and as, although apocryphal, the Acts which are recorded tend to illustrate
the history of the Church during the period to which we refer, we intend to
include them in this print of the whole Book as we find it, but separately, and
completely apart from the Acts of the legitimate Assemblies.</p>

<p>Before, however, proceeding to do so, it is considered expedient to include, as
part of the genuine record, an authenticated Copy of the Book of Policie.
When the transcript of the record for the year 1581 was put to press, and
when the “Heads of Policie,” (or Second Book of Discipline,) should have been
inserted as engrossed in the register, and as part of the proceedings of the Assembly
held that year, the Editor did not consider it necessary to do so; inasmuch
as many printed editions of that document were to be found in various publications.
Since that portion of the work, however, was printed off, he has been led, by his
inquiries, to the conclusion, that none of those editions which he has yet seen are
perfectly accurate. He has arrived at this conviction by the discovery of an <em>authenticated</em>
copy of it, attested in the year 1591, under the hand of Jas. Richie, the clerk
of Assembly, and by the signatures of the Presbytery of Haddington, in terms of an
Act of the General Assembly. He has collated that copy with others, and now deems
it his duty to incorporate in this work an exact transcript of it, the authenticity being
thus satisfactorily established. The importance of doing so, and the addition of some
collateral circumstances connected with the Book of Policie, have been suggested to
him by the fact, that the chief basis of the celebrated <span class="allsmcap">ACT ANENT CALLS</span> is alleged to
be found in that document, and much argument has been founded, both in the
Ecclesiastical and Civil Courts, on the interpretation of various passages in it, and
the authority that is due to it as an assumed record of the “fundamental”
principles of our Establishment. It is therefore desirable that the Church and the
Country should be put in possession of a genuine copy of a production, from
which practical inferences of so much moment have been deduced.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_534"></a>[534]</span></p>


<hr class="tb" />

<div class="lht fs90">

<p>In the Haddington MS. volume, (a small quarto,) from which the foregoing
copy of the Book of Policy has been transcribed, there are various other documents
ingrossed, for the guidance of that Presbytery in its proceedings. These
are&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Extracts from the Act of Assembly, 8th August 1590, Sess. 10, and 5th
July 1591, Sess. 4, with reference to subscription of the Book of Policy
by Presbytries, and the clerk supplying them with copies for that purpose.</p>

<p>2. “Ane Forme of sundrie Materis to be vsit in the Elderschip.”</p>

<p>3. The Book of Policy above inserted.</p>

<p>4. “A Schort Soume of the wholl Actis of the Kirk, takin out of the Buik of
Discipline and Registers of our Assemblies, for the instruction of Ministers
and Readaris in thair office”&mdash;
under the heads of “Doctrine”&mdash;
“Examinatione”&mdash;
“Ministrie”&mdash;
“Discipline”&mdash;
“Policie.”</p>
</div>

<p>Among these we find in the Collection of <em>Forms</em> (2) thus recorded, several
documents which illustrate the mode of settling ministers about the year 1590,
viz. a Presbyterial Warrant for “<em>Collation</em>”&mdash;the “<em>Institution</em>”&mdash;the notarial
“<em>Instrument tharupon</em>”&mdash;“ane Commission of a Benefice”&mdash;a “<em>Presentation
of a Laick Patron of ane new erection</em>.” There are also “Observations of the
Conferences betwix the Kingis Majestie and Counsells Commissionars and the
Kirks, with the Judgement of the Generall Assembly,” which appears to be attested
by Richie, the Clerk of Assembly. All these are valuable, as evidents of
the practice and history of those times; and they will form a part of the Notes
and Illustrations which we purpose to subjoin&mdash;without which, indeed, the Booke
of the Kirk alone would be insufficient to afford a satisfactory view of the laws
and usages of the Church of Scotland during the first sixty years of its existence.
It is gratifying, however, to have been enabled to lay before the Church
and the Country at present, a Copy of the Book of Policy of undoubted authenticity,
as well as to complete the publication of all the earlier authoritative Acts
of Assembly.</p>

<p>Off the Kirk and Policie thairof in generall, and quhairin it is different
frome the Ciuill Policie.</p>
</div>

<p>1. The kirk of God sumtymes is largelie takine for all thame
that professis the Evangell of Jesus Chryst, and so it is ane company
and fellowschipe, not onlie of the godlie, bot also of hypocrittis,
professing alwayis outwartlie ane trew religioun.</p>

<p>2. Uther tymis it is takine for the godlie and elect onlie.</p>

<p>3. And sumtymis for thame quho exerce the spirituall functioun
among the congregatioun of thame that profes the trewth.</p>

<p>4. The kirk in this last sence, hes ane certane power grantit be
God, according to the quhilk, it usis ane proper jurisdictioun and
gouernament, exercit to the confort of the haill kirk.</p>

<p>5. This power ecclesiasticall, is an auctoritie grantit be God the
Fader, throught the Mediator Jesus Chryst, vnto his kirk gadderit,
and having the ground in the word of God, to be putt in executioun
be thame, unto quhom the spirituall gouernament of the kirk, be
lawful calling, is committit.</p>

<p>6. The policie of the kirk, flowing fra this power, is ane ordour
or forme of spirituall gouernament, quhilk is exercit be the memberis
appointit thairto be the word of God: And thairfoir is gevine immediatlie
to the office-beirars, be quhome it is exercit to the weill of
the haill bodie.</p>

<p>7. This power is diverslie vsit: For sumtymis it is seuerallie exercit,
(chieflie be the teacheris,) sumtyme coniunctlie be mutuall consent
of thame that bear the office and charge, efter the forme of
iugement. The former is commonlie callit <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">potestas ordinis</i>, and
the vther <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">potestas jurisdictionis</i>.</p>

<p>8. These two kyndis of power have bayth ane authoritie, ane<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_538"></a>[538]</span>
ground, ane finall caus, bot ar different in the maner and forme of
executioun, as is evident of the speiking of our Master in the 16 and
18 of Mathow.</p>

<p>9. This power and policie ecclesiasticall is different and distinct
in the awin nature fra that power and policie quhilk is callit the
ciuille power, and appertenit to the ciuille gouernament of the commoun
welth: Albeit thay be bayth of God, and tend to ane end, gif
thay be richtlie usit, <em>to wit</em>, to aduance the glorie of God, and to
haue godlie and guid subiectis.</p>

<p>10. For this power ecclesiasticall, flowis immediatlie frome God,
and the Mediator Chryst Jesus, and is spirituall, not having ane
temporall heid on eirth, bot onlie Chryst, the onlie spirituall King
and Gouernour of his kirk.</p>

<p>11. Thairfoir this power and policie of the kirk, sould lene upone
the word of God immediatlie, as the onlie ground tharof, and sould
be tane frome the pure fountanis of the Scripturis, heiring the voce
of Chryst, the onlie spirituall King, and being rewlit be his lawis.</p>

<p>12. It is ane title falslie usurpit be Antichrist, to call himself heid
of the kirk, and aucht not to be attributit to angell or to mane, of
what estait soeuir he be, saiffing to Chryst, the Heid and onlie Monarche
in this kirk.</p>

<p>13. It is proper to kingis, princes, and magistrats to be callit
Lordis, and dominators ouer thair subiectis, quhom thay gouverne
civillie, bot it is proper to Chryst onlie, to be callit Lord and Maister,
in the spirituall gouernament of the kirk, and all uthers that
beris office thairin aucht not to usurp dominion therein, be callit
Lordis, bot onlie ministeris, disciplis, and servandis; For it is
Chrystis proper office to command and reull his kirk universall, and
euery particular kirk, throw his Spirit and word, be the ministrie of
mene.</p>

<p>14. Notwithstanding, as the ministeris and vtheris of the ecclesiasticall
estait, ar subiect to the magistrat ciuillie, swa aucht the persone
of the magistrat, be subiect to the kirk spirituallie, and in ecclesiasticall
gouernament.</p>

<p>15. And the exercise of bayth thais jurisdictionis can not stande
in ane persone, ordinarlie.</p>

<p>16. The ciuill power is callit the power of the sword; the
uther the power of the keyis.</p>

<p>17. The ciuile power sould command the spirituall, to exerce and
do thair office, according to the word of God: The spiritual rewlaris<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_539"></a>[539]</span>
sould require the Christiane magistrat, to minister justice, and
puniesh vyce, and to mantene the libertie and quyetnes of the kirk
within thair boundis.</p>

<p>18. The magistrat commandeth externall thingis for externall
peax and quyetnes amangis the subjectis: The ministerie handlit
externall thingis onlie, for conscience caus.</p>

<p>19. The magistrat handlit onlie externall thingis, and actionis
done befoir men: Bot the spirituall rewlaris iuge baith inwart affectionis
and externall actionis, in respect of conscience, be the word
of God.</p>

<p>20. The ciuile magistrat cravis and gettis obedience be the
sword, and uther externall menis: Bot the ministrie be the spirituall
sword, and spirituall meanis.</p>

<p>21. The magistrat nather aucht to preache, minister the sacramentis,
nor execut the censouris of the kirk, nor ʒet prescryve ony
reull how it sould be done; bot command the ministrie to obserue
the reull commandit in the word, and punishe the transgressouris
be ciuile meanis: The ministeris exerce not the ciuile jurisdictioun,
bot teaches the magistrat how it sould be exercit according to the
word.</p>

<p>22. The magistrat aucht to assist, mantene, and fortifie the jurisdictioun
of the kirk: The ministeris sould assist thair princes in all
thingis aggreable to the word; providing thay negleck not their
awin charge, be involving thame selfis in ciuile effairis.</p>

<p>23. Finallie, as ministeris are subiect to the iugement and punishment
of the magistrat in externall thingis, gif thay offend; Swa
aucht the magistrat to submit thame selfis to the discipline of the
kirk, gif thay transgres in matteris of conscience and religioun.</p>

</div>

<p class="p1 center">CAP. II.</p>

<p>1. As in the ciuile policie, the haill commoun welth consistith
in thame that ar gouernouris or magistratis, and thame that ar
gouernit and subiectis; Sa in the policie of the kirk, sum ar appointit
to be reularis, and the rest of the memberis thairof to be
reulit and obey, according to the word of God, and inspiratioun of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_540"></a>[540]</span>
his Spirit, alwayes under ane head and cheif gouernour, Jesus
Chryst.</p>

<p>2. Againe, the haill policie of the kirk consistit in thrie cheif
thingis; in doctrine, in discipline, and distributioun. With doctrine
is joint administratioun of the sacramentis.</p>

<p>3. And according to the partis of this diuision, arisit ane thriefald
sort of officiaris in the kirk; to wit, of ministeris or preacheris,
of eldaris or gouernouris, of deaconis or distributeris. And all
thais may be callit be ane generall word, ministeris of the kirk.</p>

<p>4. For albeit the kirk of God be reulit and gouernit be Jesus
Chryst, who is the onlie King, Hie Priest, and Heid thairof, ʒit he
usis the ministrie of men, as ane maist necessarie middis for this
purpois.</p>

<p>5. For sa he hes fra tyme to tyme, befoir the law, under the law,
and in tyme of the Evangell, for our greit comfort, raisit up men
indewit with the giftis of the Spirit, for the spirituall governament
of his kirk, exercesing be tham his awine power, throw his Spirit
and word, to the building of the same.</p>

<p>6. And to tak away all occasioun of tyranny, he will that they
sould reul with mutuall consent of brethrene, and equalitie of power,
euery ane according to thair functionis.</p>

<p>7. In the New Testament, and tyme of the Evangell, he hes usit
the ministrie of the apostles, propheits, evangelists, pastouris and
doctouris, in administratioun of the word: the elderschip for guid
ordour, and administratioun of discipline: the deaconschip to haive
the cure of the ecclesiasticall guidis.</p>

<p>8. Sum of thir ecclesiasticall functiouns ar ordinar, and sum extraordinar
or temporall.</p>

<p>9. Thair be thrie extraordinar functionis: the office of the apostle,
of the evangelist, and of the prophet, quhilk ar not perpetuall, and
have now ceisit in the kirk of God, except quhen he pleasit, extraordinarlie,
for ane tyme, to steir up some of thame againe.</p>

<p>10. Thair is foure ordinarie functionis or offices in the kirk of
God: the office of the pasture, minister or bishop; the office of the
docter; the presbiter or eldar; and the deacone.</p>

<p>11. Thir offices ar ordinarie, and aucht to continow perpetuallie
in the kirk, as necessarie for the gouernament and policie of the
same, and na ma offices aucht to be resauit or be sufferit in the
trew kirk of God, establishit according to his word.</p>

<p>12. Tharfore, all the ambitious titles invented in the kingdome<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_541"></a>[541]</span>
of antichryst, and in his usurpit hierarchie, quhilkis ar not ane of
thais four sortis, togidder with the offices dependand thairupone,
in ane word, aucht all utterlie to be reiected.</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p2">How the Personis that bear Ecclesiasticall Functionis ar admittit
to thair Offices.</p>
</div>

<p class="p1 center">[CAP. 3.]</p>

<p>1. Vocatioun or calling, is commoun to all that sould bear office
within the kirk, quhilk is ane lauchfull way, be the quhilk, qualifeit
personis is promotit to ane spirituall office within the kirk of God.</p>

<p>2. Without this lauchfull calling it was neuer leisum to ony persone
to middle with ony function ecclesiasticall.</p>

<p>3. Thair ar two sortis of calling; ane extraordinar, be God immediatlie,
as wer the prophets and apostles, quhilk in kirkis established
and weill alreddy reformit, hes na place.</p>

<p>4. The uther calling is ordinar, quhilk besyd the calling of God,
and inward testimony of guid conscience, hes the lauchfull approbatioun
and outward jugement of men, according to Goddis word,
and ordour establishit in his kirk.</p>

<p>5. Nane aucht to presume to enter in ony office ecclesiasticall,
without he haue this guid testimony of conscience befoir God, wha
onlie knawis the hartis of men.</p>

<p>6. This ordinarie outward calling hes twa partis; electioun and
ordinatioun.</p>

<p>7. Electioun is the chesing out, of ane persone or personis maist
able, to the office that vaikis, be the jugement of the eldarschip and
consent of the congregatioun, whom to, the persone or personis beis
appointit.</p>

<p>8. The qualiteis in generall requisit in all thame qwha sould beir
charge in the kirk, consistis in soundnes of religioun, and godlines
of lyf, according as thay ar sufficientlie set furth in the word.</p>

<p>9. In the ordour of election, it is to be eschewit, that na persone
be intrust in ony of the offices of the kirk, contrarie the will
of the congregatioun to qwhome thay ar appointit, or without the
voce of the elderschip.</p>

<p>10. Nane aucht to be intrusat, or enterit in the places alreadie<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_542"></a>[542]</span>
plantit, or in ony rowm that, vaikis not, for ony warldlie respect:
and that quhilk is callit the benefice, aucht to be nothing els, bot
the stipend of the minister that is lauchfullie callit and electit.</p>

<p>11. Ordinatioun is the seperatioun and sanctifeing of the persone
appointit of God and his kirk, eftir he be weill tryit and fund qualifeit.</p>

<p>12. The ceremonyis of ordinatioun ar, fasting and eirnest prayer,
and impositioun of handis of the elderschippe.</p>

<p>13. All thir, as thay must be rasit up be God, and be him maid
able for the wark quhairto thay ar callit; sa aucht thay to knaw
thair message to be limitat within God’s word, without the bounds
of the quhilk thay aucht not to pas.</p>

<p>14. All thir sould tak thais titles and namis onlie (least thay
be exalted and puft up in thame selfis) quhilk the Scripturis givis
thame, as thais quhilks import laubour, travell and work, and ar naimes
of offices and service, and not of idlenes, dignitie, nor warldlie honour
or prehemminence, quhilk be Chryst our Maister is expreslie
reprovit and forbiddine.</p>

<p>15. All thais office-beraris sould haue thair awin particular
flokis, amangis qwhome thay exerce thair charge.</p>

<p>16. All sould mak residence with thame, and tak the inspectioun
and ouersicht of thame, euery ane in his vocatioun.</p>

<p>17. And generallie, thir twa thingis aucht thay all to respect;
the glorie of God, and edifeing of his kirk, in dischargeing thair
dewteis in thair calling.</p>


<div class="blockquot">

gouernament, quhilk aucht to be most deir unto thame.</p>

<p>2. Thay that ar callit to the ministrie, or that offer thameselfis
tharunto, aucht not to be electit, without ane certain flok be assignit
unto thame.</p>

<p>3. Na man aucht to ingeir him self, or usurp the office, without
lawfull calling.</p>

<p>4. Thay qwha ar anis callit be God, and dewlie electit be man,
eftir that they haue anis accepted the charge of the ministrie, may
not leaue thair functionis.</p>

<p>5. The desertouris sould be admonisched, and incaice of obstinacie,
finallie excommunicat.</p>

<p>6. Na pastour may leaue his flok, without licence of the provinciall
or nationall Assemblie; quhilk gif he do, eftir admonitioun not
obeyit, let the censuris of the kirk strik upone hime.</p>

<p>7. Unto the pasture apperteins teaching of the word of God, in
seasone and out of seasone, publicklie and priuatlie, alwayis travelling
to edifie, and discharge his conscience, as Goddis word prescryuis
unto hime.</p>

<p>8. Unto the pasture onlie apperteins the administratioun of the
sacramentis, in lyk manor as the ministratioun of the word: for
baith ar appointit be God as meanis to teache us; the ane be the
ear, the uther be the eis and other senses, that be baith, knawledge
may be transferrit to the mynd.</p>

<p>9. It apperteinis be the same resone to the pasture to pray for
the peple, and namelie for the flok committit to his charge, and to
bliss thame in the name of the Lord, qwho will not suffer the blissingis
of his faythfull servand to be frustrat.</p>

<p>10. He aucht also to watche aboue the maneris of his flok, that
the better he may apply the doctrine to thame, in reprehending the
dissolut personis, and exhorting the godlie, to continew in the fear
of the Lord.</p>

<p>11. It appertenis to the minister, efter lawchfull proceding be
the elderschip, to pronunce the sentence of binding and lowsing
upone ony persone, according to the power of the keyis, grantit
unto the kirk.</p>

<p>12. It belangis alswa, eftir lawchfull proceding in the mater be
the elderschip, to solemnizat the contract of mariage betwix thame
that ar joint thairin; and to pronunce the blissing of the Lord on
thame that entir in the holie band in the fear of the Lord.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_544"></a>[544]</span></p>

<p>13. And generallie, all publick denunciations that ar to be maid
in the kirk befoir the congregationis, concerning ecclesiasticall effairis,
belang to the office of the ministrie, for he is as messenger and herauld
betwene God and the people in all thais effairis.</p>

<p>1. Ane of the twa ordinar and perpetuall functionis that trauell
in the word, is the office of the Doctour, quha may also be callit
Propheit, Bischop, Eldar, Catechesar; that is, teacher of the Catechisme,
and rudiments of religione.</p>

<p>2. His office is to oppine up the mynd of the Spirit of God within
the Scripturis, simplie, without sic applicationis as the minister usis,
to the end that the faythfull be instructed, sound doctrene teachit,
and the puritie of the Gospell not corrupted throw ignorance and
euill opinionis.</p>

<p>3. He is different from the pasture not onlie in name, bot in diuersitie
of giftis; For to the Doctour is gevine the words of knawledg,
to oppine up be simple teaching, the mystereis of the fayth; to
the Pasture the gift of wisedome, to apply the same, be exhortatioun
to the manneris of the flok, as occasioun crauit.</p>

<p>4. Under the name and office of ane Doctour, we comprehend

frome tyme to tyme cairfullie maintenit, alsweill amangis the Jewis
and Christianis as amang prophane nationis.</p>

ane haill natioun, or of all and diuers nationis professing ane Jesus
Chryst.</p>

<p>3. All the ecclesiasticall assembleis, haue power to convene lawchfullie
togidder for treating of thingis concerning the kirk, and pertening
to thair chargis.</p>

<p>4. Thay haue power to apoint tymis and places to that effect;
and ane Assemblie to appoynt the dyet, tyme, and place for ane
uther.</p>

<p>5. In all assembleis, ane moderator sould be chosine be commoun
consent of the haill brethrene conveint, quha sould propone materis,
gather the voitis, and caus guid ordour be kepit in the assembleis.</p>

<p>6. Diligence sould be tane, cheiflie be the moderator, that onlie
ecclesiasticall thingis be handlit in the assemblie, and na melling
with ony thingis pertening to the civile jurisdictioun.</p>

<p>7. Euerie assemblie hes power to send furth frome them of their
awine nomber, ane or ma visitouris to sie how all thingis be reulit
in the boundis of thair jurisdictioun.</p>

<p>8. Visitatioun of ma kirkis is na ordinar office ecclesiasticall, in
the persone of ane man; nather may the name of ane bischop be attributit
to the visitour onlie; nather is it necessar to abyd alwyse in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_547"></a>[547]</span>
ane man’s persone, bot it is the part of the eldarschip, to send out
qualifeit personis to visit, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro re nata</i>.</p>

<p>9. The finall end of all assembleis is, first to keip the religioun and
doctrine in puritie, without errour and corruptioun: nixt, to keip
cumelines and guid ordor in the kirk.</p>

<p>10. For the ordouris caus, thay may mak certane reulis and
constitutionis apperteining to the guid behaviour of all the memberis
of the kirk in thair vocatioun.</p>

<p>11. Thay haue power also to abrogat and abolish all statuts and
ordinances concerning ecclesiasticall materis, that ar found noysume
or unprofitable, or aggrie not with the tyme, or abusit be the peple.</p>

<p>12. Thay haue power to execut ecclesiasticall discipline and
punischment upone all transgressouris, and proud contempnaris of
guid ordour and policie of the kirk, and swa the haill discipline is
in thair handis.</p>

<p>13. The first kynd and sort of assembleis, although thay be within
particular congregatiounis, zet thay exerce the power, auctoritie,
and jurisdictioun of the Kirk with mutuall consent, and thairfoir
beiris sumtyme the name of the Kirk.</p>

<p>14. Quhen we speik of eldaris of the particular congregationis,
we mene not that euery particular paroche kirk cane, or may haue
thair awin particular eldarschip, speciall to landwart, bot we think
thrie or four, ma or fewar, particular kirkis, may haue ane commoun
eldarschip to thame all, to judge the ecclesiasticall causes.</p>

<p>15. Albeit it is meit that sum of the eldaris be chosine out of
euerie particular congregatioun, to concur with the rest of thair
brethrene in the commoun assemblie, and to tak up the delationis
of offencis within thair awin kirkis, and bring thame to the Assemblie.</p>

<p>16. This we gadder of the practise of the primitiue kirk, wheras
eldaris or colleges of senioris wer constitute in citeis and famous
places.</p>

<p>17. The power of thir particular elderschippis, is to uis diligent
laubour in the boundis committed to thair charge, that the kirkis be
kepit in guid ordour, to inquire diligentlie of nauchtie and unrewlie
personis, and travell to bring thame in the way againe, ayther
be admonitioun or threatning of Goddis judgements, or be correctioun.*<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>18. It perteins to the eldarschip, to tak heid, that the word of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_548"></a>[548]</span>

the hurt of the same.*<a id="FNanchor_49c" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>21. It hes power to excommunicat the obstinat.*<a id="FNanchor_49d" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>22. The power of electioun of thame qwha bearis ecclesiasticall
chargis, pertenis to this kynd of assemblie, within thair awin boundis,
being weill erectit, and constitut of mony pastouris and eldaris of

kynd of assembleis, as of thame that teache erroneous and corrupt
doctrine; that be of sclanderous lyfe, and eftir admonitioun, desist
not; that be gevine to schisme or rebellion contrare the kirk, manifest
blasphemy, simony, and all corruptioun of brybis, falset, periurie,
huredome, thift, drunkinnes, fechting, worthie of punischment

frome the kirk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_550"></a>[550]</span></p>

the provincis, as neid requyris.*<a id="FNanchor_49e" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

the said Assemblie, to propone, heir, and resone.</p>

And things generally, seruing for the weill of the haill body of

title of the kirk, and speciallie the abused titles in Papistrie, of
Prelats, Conuents, and Chapteris, aucht to attempt ony act in the
kirkis name, ayther in Counsall, Parliament, or out of Counsall,
having na commissioun of the reformit kirk within this realme.</p>

<p>23. And be act of Parliament it is providit, that the Papisticall
kirk and jurisdictioun sould have na place within the same, and na
bischop nor uther prelat in tymis cuming, sould use ony jurisdictioun
flowing from his auctoritie.</p>

<p>24. And againe, that na uther ecclesiasticall jurisdictioun sould
be acknawlegeit within this realme, bot that quhilk is, and salbe
within the reformit kirk, and flowing therfra.</p>

<p>25. So we esteme halding of chapetirs in Papisticall maner,
ayther in cathedrall kirkis, abbayis, collegis, or uther conventuall
places, usurping the name and auctoritie of the kirk, to hurt the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_558"></a>[558]</span>
patrimony thairof, or use ony uther act to the preiudice of the
same, sene the ʒeir of our Lord 1560 ʒeiris, to be abusioun and
corruptioun, contrar to the libertie of the trew kirk and lawis of the
realme, and thairfoir aucht to be annullat, reducit, and in tymis
cuming utterlie dischargit.</p>

<p>26. The dependences also of this Papisticall jurisdictioun ar to
be abolished, of the quhilk sort is the mingled jurisdiction of the
commissaris, in safar as thay mell with ecclesiasticall materis, and
haue na commissioun of the kirk thairto, bot war erectit in tyme
of our Soverainis mother, whan thingis war out of ordour. It is
an absurd thing, that sindrie of thame, having na functioun in the
kirk, sould be ingis to ministeris, and depose thame fra thair rowmis:
Thairfoir, ather thay wald be dischargit to meddle with ecclesiasticall
matteris, or it wald be limitat to thame in quhat materis thay
might be Juges, and not hurt the libertie of the kirk.</p>

<p>27. Thay also that of befoir war of the ecclesiasticall estait in
the Papis kirk, or that ar admittit of new to Papisticall titles, and
now ar tollerat be the lawis of the realme, to posses the twa pairt of
thair ecclesiasticall rentis, aucht not to haue ony forder libertie, bot
to intromet with the portioun assignit and grantit to thame for
thair lyfetime, and not, under the abusit titles quhilks thay had,
to dispone the kirk rentis, set takis and fewis thairof at thair
plesour, to the greit hurt of the kirk, and pure lauboraris that dwell
upone the kirk-landis, contrarie to all guid conscience and ordour.</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p2">Certane speciall Heidis of Reformatioun quhilk we crave.</p>
</div>

<p class="p1 center">CAP. 12.</p>

<p>1. Quhatsoeuir haue bene spokine of the offices of the kirk, the
seuerall power, the office-beraris thair conjunct power also, and
last of the patrimony of the kirk, we onderstand it to be, the right
reformation, whilk God cravis at our handis, That the kirk be ordourit
according thairto, as with that ordour quhilk is maist aggreable
to the word of God.</p>

<p>2. Bot becaus sumthingis willbe twichit in particular, concerning
the estait of the countrie, and that quhilk we principallie seik
to be reformit in the same, we haue collectit thame in thir heidis
following:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_559"></a>[559]</span></p>

<p>3. <em>First</em>, seing the haill countrie is devydit in provinces, and thir
provinces agane ar diuidit in paroches, alsweill in landwart as in
townis; in euery paroche of reasonable congregationis, there wald
be placit ane or ma pasturis to feid the flok, and na pasture or
minister, aucht to be burdenit with the particular charge of ma
flockis or kirks thene ane alanarlie.</p>

<p>4. And becaus it willbe thocht hard to find out pasturis or ministeris
to all the paroche kirkis of the realme, alsweill in landwart as
in borrows townis, we think, be the advice of sic as commissioun
may be gevine to, be the kirk and the prince, paroches in landwart
or small villages, may be joint twa or thrie or ma, in sum places
togidder, and the principall and maist commodious kirkis to stand,
and to be repairit sufficientlie, and qualifeit ministeris placet thereat;
and the uther kirkis, quhilk ar not fund necessar, may be sufferit
to decay, thair kirk-zairdis alwayis being kepit for buriall
places: And in sum places quher neid requyris, ane parochine,
where the congregatioun is ouir greit for ane kirk, may be diuidit
in twa or ma.</p>

<p>5. Doctouris wald be appointit in universities, collegis, and
uther places neidfull, and sufficientlie prouydit, for to oppin up the
meaning of the Scripturis, and to haue the charge of scoles, and
teache the rudiments of religioun.</p>

<p>6. As to eldaris, thair waldbe sum to be censuris of the maneris
of the peple, ane or ma in euerie congregatioun; bot not an
assemblie of eldaris in euery particular kirk, bot onlie in the townis
and famous places quher resort of men of jugement and habilitie to
that effect; may be had.</p>

<p>7. Quhair the eldaris of particular kirkis about may convene
togidder, and haue ane commoun elderschip and assemblie-place
amongis thame, to treat of all thingis that concerne the congregatioun
of whome thay haue the ouersicht.</p>

<p>8. And as thair aught to be men appointit to unit and diuyd the
paroches, as necessitie and commoditie requiris, Sa wald thair be
appointit be the generall kirk, with assent of the Prince, sic men as
feireth God, and knew the estait of the countreis, that war able to
nominat and designe places, quhere the assembleis of particular
elderschippis sould convene, to tak consideratioun of the dioces as
thay war diuidit of auld, and of the estait of the countreis and provinces
of the realme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_560"></a>[560]</span></p>

<p>9. Lykeways as concerning provinciall and synodall assembleis,
consideratioun war easie to be had, how mony and in quhat places
thay war to be haldine, and how oftene thay sould convene,&mdash;aucht
to be referit unto the libertie of the general kirk, and ordour to be
appoyntit therein.</p>

<p>10. The Nationall Assembleis of this countrie, callit commounlie
the Generall Assembleis, aught alwayis to be retenit in thair awin
libertie, and to haif their awin place, with power to the kirk to appoint
tymis and places convenient thairfoir.</p>

<p>11. And all men, alsweill magistratts as inferiouris, to be subject
to the jugement of the same in ecclesiasticall causis, without ony
reclamatioun or appellatioun to onie iudge, ciuile or ecclesiasticall,
within the realme.</p>

<p>12. The libertie of the electioun of personis callit to ecclesiasticall
functionis, and obseruit without interruptit continewnce salang as
the kirk was not corruptit be Antichryst, we desyr to be restoirit
and retenit within this realme:</p>

<p>13. So that nane be intrusit upone ony congregatioun, aither be
the Prince or ony inferiour persone, without lawchfull electioun
and the assent of the peple ouir quhom the persone is placet, as
the practise of the apostolicall primitiue kirk and guid ordour
craves.</p>

<p>14. And becaus this ordour, quhilk Goddis word cravis, can not
stand with patronages and presentationis to benefices, usit in the Papis
kirk, We desyr all thame that trewlie feiris God, eirnestlie to considder,
that forswamekle as the names of patronagis and beneficis,
togidder with the effect thairof, are flowene frome the Pape, and corruptioun
of the canone law onlie insafar as thairby ony persone was
intruised and placit ovir kirkis hauing <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">curam animarum</i>; And forswameikle
as that maner of proceding hes na ground in the word of
God, but is contrar to the same, and to the said libertie of electioun,
thay aucht not now to have place in this licht of reformatioun:
And therefoir quhasaever will trewlie imbrace Goddis word,
and desyr the kingdome of his Sone Jesus Chryst to be aduancit,
thay will also imbrace, and resaue that policie and ordour quhilk
the word of God, and upright stait of his kirk craves, vtherwyse it
is in vane that thay sould haue profest the same. Notwithstanding
as concerning uther patronages of benefices that have not <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">curam
animarum</i>, (as they speik,) sic as ar chaplanreis, prebendaries fundeit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_561"></a>[561]</span>
upon temporall landis, and annuallis, and siclyk, may be reseruit
unto the ancient patronis, to dispone that upone, quhan thay veaik,
to scolleris and bursaris, as thay are requirit be the act of Parliament.</p>

<p>15. As to the kirk rentis in generall, we desyr the ordour to be
admittit and mantenit amangis us, that may stand with sinceritie
of Goddis word, and practes of the puritie of the kirk of Christ.</p>

<p>16. <em>To wit</em>, that as was befoir spokine, in the haill rent and patrimony
of the kirk, (excepting the small patronagis befoir mentionat,)
may be divydit in four partis and portionis: Ane thairof to be assignit
to the pasture for his intertenement and for hospitalitie; ane uther
to the eldaris, deaconis, and utheris officiaris of the kirk, sic as clerkis
of assembleis, takaris up of the psalms, beadallis and keparis of the
kirks, safar as thay ar necessar; joyning thairwith also, the doctouris
of scoles, to help the ancient foundationis quhere neid requireth:
The thrid portioun to be bestowit unto the pure memberis of the
faithfull, and hospitallis: The fourt for reparatioun of the kirkis,
and utheris extraordinar chargis as ar profitable for the kirk, and
also for the commoun welth, gif neid require.</p>

<p>17. We desyr thairfoir, the ecclesiasticall guidis to be upliftit,
and distributit faithfullie, to quhome thay appertene, and that be the
ministrie of the deaconis, to quhais office properlie the collectioun
and distributioun thereof belangis: that the pure may be answerit
of thair portioun thereof, and thay of the ministrie leue without
care and solicitud, as also the rest of the thesaurarie of the kirk
may be ressauit, and bestowit to the richt uses.</p>

<p>18. Gif thayes deaconis be electit with sic qualiteis as Goddis
word craves to be in thame, thair is na feir that they sall abuse
thame selfis in thair office, as the prophane collectouris did of befoir.</p>

<p>19. Zit becaus this vocatioun apperes to mony to be dangerous,
let them be oblisht (as thay war of auld) to ane ʒeirlie compt to the
pasturis and elderschip; and gif the kirk and Prince think expedient,
lat cautioneris be oblist for thair fidelitie, that the kirk rents
onnawayis be delapidat.</p>

<p>20. And to the effect this ordour may tak place, it is to be prouydit,
that all utheris intromettouris with the kirkis rentis, collectouris
generall or speciall, whidder it maybe by appointment of the
Prince, or utherwayis, be denudit of forder intromissioun thereof,
and suffer the kirk rentis in tymis cuming to be haillalie intromettit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_562"></a>[562]</span>
with be ministrie of the deaconis, and distribute to the usis afoir
mentionat.</p>

<p>21. And also, to the effect that the ecclesiasticall rentis may
suffice to the uses for the quhilk thay ar to be appointit, we think
it necessar to be desyred, that all alienationis, setting in fewis or
takis of the rentis of the kirk, alsweill landis as teindis, in hurt and
diminutioun of the auld rentallis, be reducit and annullat, and the
patrimony of the kirk restoirit to the formar and auld libertie.</p>

<p>22. And lykewayis, that in tymis cuming, the teindis be set to
nane bot to the laubouraris of the ground, or ellis not set at all, as
it was aggriet upone, and subscryuit be the nobilitie befoir.</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p2">The Vtilitie that sall flow of this Reformatioun to all Estaitis.</p>
</div>

<p class="p1 center">CAP. 13.</p>

<p>1. Seing the end of this spirituall gouernament and policie,
quhairof we spak, is, that God may be glorifeit, the kingdome of
Jesus Chryst advancit, and all thay quho ar of his mysticall body,
may leve peceablie in conscience: Thairfoir we dar bauldlie affirme,
that all thay quha haue trew respect to thais endis, will evin for conscience
caus, gladlie aggrie and conforme thame selfis to this ordour,
and aduance the same, safar as lyis in thame, that their conscience
being set at rest, thay may be replenisched with spirituall gladnes in
geving full obedience to that quhilk Goddis word and the testimony
of thair conscience dois craue, and refusing all corruptionis contrare
unto the same.</p>

<p>2. Nixt, we sall becum an example and patrone of guid and
godlie ordour to uther nationis, cuntreis, and kirkis professing the
same religioun with us, that as thay haue glorifeit God in our continewing
in the sinceritie of the word hitherto, without all errouris,
(praise be to His name,) sa thay may haue the lyk occasioun in our
conuersation, quhen as we conforme our selfis to that discipline,
policie, and guid ordour, quhilk the same word and puritie of reformatioun
craves at our handis; vtherwayis this feirfull sentence
may be iustlie said to us, The servand knawand the will of the maister,
and not doing it.</p>

<p>3. Mairouir, gif we haue ony pitie or respect to the puir memberis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_563"></a>[563]</span>
of Chryst, quha sa greatlie increase and multiplie amangis us,
we will not suffer thame to be langer defraudit of that part of the
patrimony of the kirk, quhilk justlie belangis unto thame: And be
this ordour, gif it be dewlie put in executioun, the burding of thame
sall be takine of us to our greit confort, the streitis sallbe changed
of the cryingis and murmuringis of thame; as we salbe na mair
sklander to uther nationis, as we haue hitherto bene, for not taking
ordour with the puir amangis us, and causing the word quhilk we
profess to be euill spokine of, giving occasioun of sclander to the
enemies, and offending the consciences of the semple and godlie.</p>

<p>4. Besyds this, it sallbe a greit ease and commoditie to the haill
commoun peple, and releving thame of the beilding and uphalding
of thair kirkis, in bigging of briggis and uther lyk public warkis;
to the laubourars of the ground in the payment of thair teindis; and
schortlie in all cheif thingis, quhairunto thay have bene hitherto
rigorouslie handlit be thame that war falsely callit kirkmen, thair
tackkismen, factouris, and extortionaris.</p>

<p>5. Finallie, to the Kingis Majestie and common-welth of the
countrie, this profit sall redound, That the uther effairs of the kirk
being sufficientlie provydit according to the distributioun of the
quhilk hes bene spokin, the superplus being collectit into the
thesaurarie of the kirk, may be profitablie imployit, and liberallie
bestowit upon the extraordinar support of the effairis of the Prince
and commoun-welth, and speciallie of that part quhilk is appoyntit
for reparatioun of the kirks.</p>

<p>6. Sa, to conclude; all being willing to apply thameselfis to this
ordour, the peple suffering them selfis to be reulit according thairunto,
(the Princes and Magistrats thame selfis not being exemit,)
and thay that ar placit in ecclesiasticall estait, rychtlie reuling and
governing, God sallbe glorifeit, the kirk edifeit, the boundis thairof
inlargit, Chryst Jesus and his kingdome set up, Sathane and his
kingdome subuertit, and God sall dwell in the meddis of us, to our
comfort, throw Jesus Chryst, quha, togidder with the Fader and
the Halie Ghaist, abydeth blissit in all eternitie. So be it.</p>

<p>In lyke maner the Conference finding that nothing mair weakened the credit
and strenth of the ministerie and discipline of the Kirk against Papists, nor
mair emboldned the adversares to goe fordward in their erronious course, than
the appearances of division in the ministrie amang themselves, and the alienatione
quhilk seemeth to be of his Majestie’s mynd from some of them: Therefore,
for the removeing of all eye lysts and shew of division and alienation of
mynds, either amang the ministers themselves, or of his Majestie’s good affection
and favour from any of them, was thocht ane soveragne remedie for the effectuall
suppressing of papistrie. And having searched and found out the cause of the
distraction, of alienation of mynds forsaids in the ministrie, to be partlie a feare
that some of the brether was of purpose, and upon course to subvert the libertie
and discipline of the Kirk of Scotland, by removing the Sessiouns, Presbytries,
Provinciall and Generall Assemblies, or by vsurping in their awn persons some
sick tyrranous and vnlawfull jurisdiction as is no wayes lawfull, neither to be
tolerated in a truelie and Christian reformed Kirk, and to shake off that obedience
to all good ordour and comelines, established or to be established by
the lawfull assemblies with his Majestie’s consent; and particularlie a griefe
that some of the brether now banished foorth of his Majestie’s dominions, and
uthers diseased, be long warding and relegation from their habitations and
charges: And finding lykewayes be the declaration of his Majestie’s commissioners,
and sick as were privie to his Majestie’s mynd, that his Hieness
was no less grieved with divers formes and actions of some of the ministrie,
for not haveand due regard and care to vse sick course in their actions and administration
in the Kirk affaires, as might serve to intertain a solid peace and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_568"></a>[568]</span>
quyetnes betweene his Majestie and them, as lykewayes mutuallie amang themselves,
and in speciall, that the charge of their governement was oftentymes almost
ordinarlie committed to sick as, for lake of wisdome and experience, was
no wayes able to keep their estate in any good frame or quyetnes, quherunto his
Majestie imputed the chiefest cause of all the greifes and troubles quhilk had
fallen out this lang tyme amangst the ministrie themselves, or any offence given
be any of them to his Majestie, and that his Majestie could not be satisfied
quhill this inconvenient were first removed, and a faithfull remedie provyded,
that thereafter the lyke sould not fall out, quhilk his Majestie summarlie comprehended
in this, if the affaires of the Kirk sould be administrat be the
wysest and most godlie; wheranent also his Majestie’s speciall overture as heirafter
followes, was prepared:</p>

<p>It is his Majestie’s advyse to this Assemblie, and pleasure, that presentlie there
be nominat in everie Presbyterie ane of the godlie and most grave, of greatest
authoritie and experience, and meitest for governement, to haue the moderation of
his Presbyterie quhere he remaines, till the present sturres and fyre of dissention
qwhilk is amangs the ministrie, and the great prejudice of the authoritie and
credit, and the hinderance of the gospell and his Majestie’s high offence, be
qwenshed and taken away; and the noblemen and others professing Papistrie
within this kingdome so represt by justice and execution of lawes, or be the labours
of the ministrie and discipline of the Kirk, that they be not able to hinder
the course of the gospell, or strenthen and encourage the credit and power of laws
against them, be committed unto the saids Moderators, and that the Bishops in
the Presbyteries qwhere they are resident, in ane of the kirks of the Bishopric,
have this care and burden committed unto them; and seeing that it will crediblie
fall out that in the Presbytries, through the greatness of parties and the langsumnes
and difficultie of processe, the saids Moderators will sometymes be constrained
to referre the doing thereof to the Provinciall Assemblie and the Moderator
thereof, it is therfor his Majestie’s advyse and pleasure that the Moderator of the
Provinciall Assemblie, and persewing of actions of greatest difficultie be comitted
unto the Bishop makand lawfull residence within the said province, or to the
worthiest of them qwhen it sall happen moe than ane to be in ane province, in
respect that his Majestie hes bestowed upon them, moyane and places qwherby
they may be able to beare out the charges and burden of difficile and dangerous
actions qwhilk other ministers were not able to sustane, and lykewayes by their
credit and place in counsell, are able in sick causes, to procure greater celeritie
and execution of justice as in sick cases will be requisite, than vthers.</p>

<p>The Conference having advysed, first anent the taking away of the forsaids
fiers and suspition and satisfaction of the greifes, and willing to understand of
his Majestie’s Commissioners, and sick as latelie had been acquainted with his
Majestie’s intentions, and willing lykewise to heare the declaration of the Bishops
thereanent as touching their owne intentions and purposes in this errand: It was
declareit, that it was not in any wayes his Majestie’s purpose and intention to subvert
and overthrow the present discipline of the Kirk of Scotland, but rather to
augment and strenthen the samen so farre as it could serve for the well of the
gospell and the restraint of vyce, and to sie sick eyelists and offences as in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_569"></a>[569]</span>
administration thereof was the occasion of just miscontentment unto his Majestie,
and a hinderance to the credit and authoritie of the ministrie themselves, removed
and tane away, be sick good overtures as is after expressed.</p>

<p>In signe quhereof, as there is nothing done in derogatione of the halding of the
Session, the Presbytries and Provinciall Assemblies, so it was never his Majestie’s
intention, but that the keeping of Generall Assemblies at certaine competent
tymes was, and is a most necessarie mean for the preservation of peace and union
in the Kirk, and extermination of all heresie and schisme in the same: Therefor
his Majestie doeth graceouslie declare, that as the Act of Parliament doeth still
stand in full force and effect for the conveining of Assemblies anes every zeir by
his Majestie’s direction, so it is his Majestie’s will that the day of conveining the
next Assembly sallbe at Edinburgh the last Tuesday of July.</p>

<p>Sicklyke, the haill Bishops declarit that it was not their intention to usurpe
and exerce any tyrannous and unlawfull jurisdiction and power over the brethren,
nor to ingyre themselves any wayes unlawfullie in the Kirkes governement, or any
part thereof, farder nor sall be committed to them be the Presbytries, Provinciall
or Generall Assemblies; and if it sould happen to fall out that they, or any of
them, sould be found to doe [in] the contrair, then, and in that case, they were content
to submitt themselves unto the censure of the Kirk, als humblie as any other
of the brether of the ministrie.</p>

<p>In lykemaner, it was declared that his Majestie, according to his occasiones,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
lang ammitie and patience towards sick as happened to offend him of the ministrie,
had delayed for a very lang tyme to give foorth any sentence against the
brether now banished, still hopeing that by their good behaviour and humble sute
for his Hienes’ pardon and favour, his Majestie have occasion to shew his clemencie
towards them; and albeit his Majestie beand justlie provocked, was moved to give
forth his will anent their banishment, Yet imediatlie, being requested in their
favours be the Bishops and other brethren there present with them, it pleased his
Majestie to declare that their want of his favour proceidit upon their awin default
quho had never humbled themselves to seek his pardon as became them.</p>

<p>In respect quhereof it was thoght meit to direct the Bishop of Edinburgh,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Mrs
Patrick Sharp, Patrick Gallaway, Robert Wilkie, Jo<sup>n</sup>. Strauchane, W<sup>m</sup>. Hall,
Jo<sup>n</sup>. Hay, with the Moderator of the Assemblie, to write a letter to the said
brether in their name, [givand them advyce so to frame and send their humble]
sute to his Majestie for his pardon and favour to them as may give his Majestie
greatest satisfaction, and that the Assemblie earnestlie requeisted his Majestie’s
Commissioners and others Noblemen employed be his Majestie to this Assemblie,
so soone as their said supplication sould come from them of the tenor forsaid,
to concurre be their credit and intercession with his Majestie, to procure
them to be [made] partakers of that gracious favour quhilk his Majestie at no
tyme heirtofoir refused to any of that profession quhom he fand willing to acknowledge
and amend their oversight, and have recourse to his clemencie; for
the quhilk declaration the Conference praised God, and thoght good that the
brethren sould be written to as is befoir said, and be the brethrin befoir named.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_570"></a>[570]</span></p>

<p>Thereafter, having considered the overture proponed to them in his Majestie’s
name, and finding it in shew, to carie some appearance of novation in the discipline
of the Kirk, and fearing that it might bring with it some inconvenients:
Therfor the Conference wald not take on them to determine their advyce theranent,
quhill first the mater were exactlie resolvit in their presence, and sufficient
remeid provyded for preventing all inconvenients might follow thereupon:
Whereupon a good number of the most learned, godlie, and wysest of the
brethren of the Conference, being appointed to reason and heare ane after another;
and having exactly and at good length reasoned and examined quhatsumever
inconvenients might follow upon the establishing of the said overture, it was
considered and found at last to be ane universall voyce and consent of the whole
Conference, but contradiction, that the said overture was both wise and godlie,
and tending many wayes to the well of the Kirk: Provydeing that certaine cautions
were observed for preventing such evils as might happen to fall out incase the
said Moderators, or any of them, [should] either arrogantlie presume to usurp any
farder power in the saids Presbyteries and Assemblies than it is comelie and lawfull
for Moderators in sicke cases to doe, and presentlie and without innovating
and altering at their owne fantassies, and at their owne hands, the custome that
the discreit Moderators have used and aught to use in that place, or utherwayes
be found remisse in proponeing or prosecuting any good purpose or overtouris
quhilk sould be giuen in be the brethren or any of them to the saids Presbyteries
and Assemblies, and according to the doubts quhilk in reasoning were found
out and feared, the cautions following were aggried upon:</p>

<p>1. That it be provyded that the Moderators of Presbytries and provinciall Assemblies
to be nominat and chosen according to his Majestie’s overtures, sall presume
to doe nothing in the Presbytries and provinciall Assemblies where he
moderateis, without the speciall advyse and consent of the brethren.</p>

<p>2. That the acts of the Generall Assemblies and caveats therein prescryved
anent Bishops be observed.</p>

<p>3. That they sall vse no jurisdiction or power farder than the Moderators of
Presbytries and provinciall Assemblies has bein in use of, be the constitutions of
the Kirk befoir.</p>

<p>4. Incase it sall happen the Moderators of Presbyteries and provinciall Assemblies
to be absent the time of the convention, then it sall be in the power of the
saids provincialls and Presbytries, to nominate and choose out the wisest and
gravest or their brether, to moderat their meitings in absence of the saids Moderators.</p>

<p>5. Quhen the place of the Moderator in any Presbyterie sall happen to vaike,
the election of another to succeed in his rowme, sall be made be the whole provinciall
Assemblie, with consent of his Majestie’s Commissioners, if any happen
to be there present for the tyme.</p>

<p>6. And when any of the saids Moderators sall happen to depart this life betwixt
Assemblies, it sall be lawfull to the Presbyteries to nominat ane of the
gravest and worthiest of the number to continue in the Moderation of the Presbyterie
qwhill the nixt provinciall Assemblie.</p>

<p>7. The Moderators of the Presbyteries sall be subject to the tryall and censure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_571"></a>[571]</span>
of the Provincialls; and in case it sall happen that they be found to be remisse
in the discharge of their duetie, or [to have presumed] to usurpe over
their brethren any farder power than is given them be their Assemblie, it sall be
ane cause to them of deprivation from their office of Moderator, and they sall be
depryved therefra be the saids provincialls.</p>

<p>8. In lykemaner, the Moderator of the provinciall Assemblies sall be tryed and
censured be the Generall Assemblie; and if he be found there to have been
remisse from his office of Moderation, or to have usurped any farder power nor
the simple place that ane Moderator, he sall be depryved fra his said office of
Moderator be the Generall Assemblie.</p>

<p>9. That the Moderator of ilk Presbyterie and provinciall Assemblie, with the
scrybes being chosen, faithfull, wise, and formall men, be astrictit to be present
at all Generall Assemblies as members thereof, and to have the rigor of the acts
and proceiding of the Presbytries and provincialls there present with them, that
their fidelitie and diligence may be sein be the Generall Assemblie, and the estate
of the countrey therby knawen.</p>

<p>10. That it sall be leisum to ilk Presbyterie to send Commissioners to the
Generall Assemblie, by and attour the Moderator and Scrybe, two or thrie, according
to the act of our Assemblie anent the Commissioners of Presbyteries, if
they sall think it expedient.</p>

<p>11. Farder, it is heirby declared, that notwithstanding of any thing done at this
tyme, the Sessions, Presbyteries, Provincialls and Generall Assemblies, are to be
observed, keeped, and obeyed as they have bein heirtofoir.</p>

<p>12. That the Moderator of the Generall Assemblie be chosen be vote of the
said Assemblie, certaine leits being first nominat and proponed frielie, as use hes
bein in tymes bypast.</p>

<p>13. That in everie Provinciall Assemblie where there is no Bishop makand
actuallie lawfull residence, and haveand the Moderation of ane of the Presbyteries,
the Moderators of the (meitest of the) Presbyteries within the said province
beand proponed on leitt, the meitest of them sall be chosen be the said Assemblie
Moderator thereof, his Majestie’s Commissioners’ consent there present beand
had therto.</p>

<p>And farder, the Conference having examined the rolls of ilk Presbyterie, to
sie if any was meiter to use the office of moderation than these quhilk befoir hes
bein nominat to have the care of the dilation of Papists and uncommunicatis,
they fand in their judgement, that the same persons was of all uthers, in everie
Presbyterie, meitest alsweill to moderat as to haue care of dilation forsaid; reserveand
alwayes unto the ministers of ilk Presbyterie there convinit, their awne
priviledge and power, to nominat unto the Assemblie, a meiter if any be in the
Presbyterie for the moderation; and therfor the said Conference finds it expedient,
that the persons forsaids accept and take upon them presentlie the said
office of moderation within the Presbyteries respective, and that the Presbyteries
embrace and allow of them; and for this effect, that the saids Moderators and
Presbyteries be requeisted therunto earnestlie be this Assemblie, and if neid beis,
lykewayis charged that the Kirk of God be not long frustrat of the comfortable
effects that the forsaid ordour is able shortlie, be the grace of God, to produce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_572"></a>[572]</span></p>

<p>This overture beand proponed and declared at lenth in presence of the full
Assemblie, everie article and heid thereof was with ane uniforme consent and
allowance of all, without contradiction, except only so farre as concerned the
Moderators in moderating of Presbyteries, and their continuance of the office of the
Moderator bezond the accustomed tyme, quheranent certaine doubts beand proponit
and satisfied, and the Bishops haveand given their declaration foorth of
their awne mouthes anent their intentions and purpose, to be subject unto the
acts and caveats of the Generall Assemblies, and to make residence within such a
space as sould be limitated to everie ane of them be this present Assemblie; and if
it sould be found expedient for the well of the Kirk, that other meiter and more
worthie than they, to possesse and occupie their places, to demitt their benefices
at the pleasure of the Assemblie; his Majestie’s consent [and approbatione] beand
had thereto, wherein they promised, and if neid were, to be earnest suitars at his Majestie’s
hands. Lykeas some of them declared, that they had alreadie most humblie
craved the same of his Majestie for the respect they had to take away all offence
from their brethren, provyding alwayes if aither, upon his Majestie’s advyse or probation
to the Assemblie, or their awne supplication, the Generall Assemblie be moved
heirafter, to grant them any relaxation of any of the caveats, quhilk upon good
reason might appeare to the said Assemblie to be over strait, that this their promise
sall make no derogation to the libertie quhilk the Assemblie heirafter sall
be moved to grant them.</p>

<p>It was voted, and be pluralitie of votes concluded, to witt, his Majestie’s Commissioners,
whole Nobilitie, Erles, and Barrons, to the number of threttie-three,
together with ane hundreth twentie and saxe of the ministrie votting affirmative,
that the said overture anent the continuance of the Moderator qwhill the present
division of the kirk be removed, and the whole brethren broght to the unitie of
mynd and affection qwhilk is agreeable to their calling, and may serve best to
the furtherance of the cause of God, and overthrow of all contrarie cause, and
the Papists alse fullie reprist or brocht to the obedience of the gospell, sould passe
and be enacted as ane of the conclusions of this Assemblie;&mdash;the forsaids caveats
beand alwayes keeped be everie ane of the saids Moderators, and the contraveeners
censured and punished as is befor expressed&mdash;foure only of the whole
Assemblie be their votes disassenting therfra, and uther foure refusing to vote

Reid, Peter Hewat, Edward Hepburne, and John Hay.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sess. 2<sup>a</sup>, Julii 27.</p>

<p>Forsuameikle as ane of the maist speciall causes of the convention of this present
Assemblie is for suppressing of papistrie and idolatrie, qwhilk dayly mair
and mair increases within this realme, and repressing of Papists, Jesuits, and Seminarie
Priests, qwhois number still mair and mair increases within the same, to
the great dishonour of God and overthrow of trew religione profest within this
realme, if the same be not with some solide remead obviat in tyme: Therefore it
is thocht expedient be the Assemblie, that before all uther things, this article concerning
Papists and Papistrie be first advysit upon and concludit: And to the
effect the Assemblie may the more solidlie and with the greater light proceed in
the said matter, therefore they have ordaynit that the Commissioners of every Synod
at the rysing of this Sessione conveine themselves severallie, and make ane
roll conteining the number of Papists and the names of them within the bounds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_576"></a>[576]</span>
of their Synod: 2. The causes why Papistrie, Superstitione, and Idolatrie is come
to so great ane height within this realme: 3. The remedies for suppressing all
sorts of Papists and Idolaters within the same, viz. Papists already excommunicat,
Papists qwho hes sworne and subscrivit to the treuth, and yet refuises to imbrace
the same, and Papists that in word profess the truth, but in doctrine and deid
contrairs the same: 4. What forme of proceeding every Synod hes usit against
the Papists within their bounds: Quhilks articles the saids Synods shall put in
wreit, and delyver the same to the Privie Conferrence at three afternoone.</p>

<p>It is lykewayes ordaynit that every Synod shall make ane particular roll of the
names of such as are receipters of Jesuits, traffiqueing Papists, and Seminarie
Priests within their bounds, and delyver the same privilie to the Earle of Dumbar,
his Majestie’s Commissioner, to the effect order may be taken thereanent.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, Because the Marques of Huntlie hes been lang under proces and censure
of excommunicatione before the Synods of Aberdeen and Morray, and in respect
of his continuance and indurat superstitione of Papistrie and Idolatrie, they have
orderly led and deducit the proces unto the finall sentence, the pronuncing
quherof hes been continowit be them from tyme to tyme, upon hope of his Lordship’s
amendment and turning from Idolatrie and Papisticall superstitione to the
trew religion presently professit within this realme, and because they finde no
hope of the same, but be the contrair greater obstinacie: Therefore the haill Assemblie
in ane voyce decerns and ordaynes the sentence of excommunicatione to
be pronuncit against his Lordship, with all possible diligence, and continows the
declaratione of the place quhen the same shall be done and be quhom, to the nixt
Sessione.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sess. 3<sup>a</sup>, 27 Julij.</p>

<p>Quhilk day, in presence of the haill Assemblie, compeirit Sir Thomas Kar of
Hircha, Knight, in name of George Marques of Huntlie, and presentit ane
supplicatione in name of the said noble Lord beirand as followis: Because that
conscience is the only argument that movit me this wayes to protract tyme till
I had perfect resolutione, and being far from an opinator, or ane that is given
over to self-will, as appearit be my yielding to hear conferrence, and, lastly, be
my going to the Kirk. I first wald have cravit, if possibly it might have been
done, that I might have been heard with myne own mouth, that I might most
heartilie intreatit that ane tyme might be condescendit on by your worships,
within the quhilk, as it shall please you to conclude, I offer either to satisfy the
Kirk, or presently to find surety under great soumes to avoyd the countrey
before this day to be prescryvit be your worships. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sic subscribitur</i>, <span class="smcap">Huntlie</span>:
And conforme thereto desyrit the same to be considerit, and requests in respect
of the offers therein conteinit the pronouncing of the sentence of excommunicatione

being ryplie advysit, fand the offers conteinit in the supplicatione to be very
frivolous, and no wayes inclyning to obedience and satisfactione; in respect
quhereof, and for many other causes, and in speciall, because his Lordship, be
his band, subscrivit with his hand upon the last of Junii 1608, presently produced
in face of the Assemblie be the Commissioners of Aberdene, band<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_577"></a>[577]</span>

thereof and the 17th of July last bypast, otherwayes the ministrie to proceed
with the sentence of excommunicatione against him, as in the said band at
mair lenth is conteint: Therefore, the Assemblie, all in ane voyce, ordaynes
the sentence of excommunicatione presently to be pronuncit against him be the
Moderator of the Assemblie, in face of the haill Assemblie, but ony delay; conforme
to the qwhilk ordinance, Mr James Law, Bischop of Orknay, Moderator
of this present Assemblie, in face thereof, in maist solemne forme, pronuncit the
sentence of excommunion against George Marques of Huntlie; qwhilk sentence
is ordaynit to be intimat in all the kirks of this realme be the ministry the next
Sonday immediately after their returning from this Assemblie; and in speciall,
they command and ordayne the brethren of the Synod of Aberdeen and Morray
to intimat the said sentence in their kirks immediatelie after their returning, and
inhibites and maist straitly charges them, and every ane of them, that they receave
nae offers of satisfaction frae the said Marques, but be speciall advyce of
his Majestie and the kirk had therto.</p>

<p>The Commissioners appoyntit in the former Sessione for giving in the names
of Papists, the causes of their increase, and remedie to obveat the same, producit
their particular rolls, containing the saids heads, qwhilk the Assemblie thocht

Pat. Simpsone, Mr Wm. Cowper, John Clappertoune, John Hall, and George

the next morning, that after, they may be intreatit in face of the Assemblie.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sess. 4<sup>a</sup>, Julii 28.</p>

<p>Forsuameikle as the brethren of the Presbyterie of Glasgow and Synod of
Clyddisdale quho were appointit to deall and conferre with William Earle of Angus,
Lord Dowglass, for bringing of him from blindness and superstitione of
Papistrie and Idolatrie to the acknowledging of the trewth profest within this
realme, did testifie in presence of the Assemblie, that they saw no appearance in
his Lordship of conversione from his errors, but that rather by all evident
tokens he was the more obstinat and obdurat in heresie of Papistrie, quhilk he
some tyme abjurit before be subscryving of the trew religione presently profest
within this realme: Therefore the Generall Assemblie ordaynes the Presbyterie
of Glasgow to proceed against the said Earle with the sentence of excommunicatione
conforme to the censures of the Kirk, with all possible diligence, and
that they pronunce the said sentence against him betwixt and the 18 of September
nixt to come, to quhom the Assemblie committs their haill power to that
effect; discharging and inhibiting any of them to receave any offers of him for
absolving of him from the said sentence, without the advyce of his Majestie and

<p>Forsuameikle as the brethren of the Presbyterie of Perth quho were appoyntit
to deall and conferre with Frances Earle of Erroll, for bringing him from blindness
and superstitione of Papistrie and Idolatrie to the acknowledging of the
treuth presently profest within this realme, did testifie in presence of the Assemblie
that they could see no appearance in his Lordship of conversione from his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_578"></a>[578]</span>

his erracie of Papistrie, quhilk he sometyme abjurat before be subscryving of
the trew Religion presently profest within this realme: Therefore the Generall
Assemblie decerns and ordaynes the Presbytrie of Perth to proceed against the

<p>Forsuameikle as be the declaratione of the brethren of the Presbytrie of Irvine,
it was made known to the Assemblie, that after long dealing and conferrence
had be them with the Lord Semple for bringing him to the acknowledging of the
truth and imbracing of the sincere religione, they could not reap any good fruit
of their labours and travills taken with him, but be the contrair he still continowit
obstinat and indurat in his detestable error of Papistrie and Idolatrie, to the
great hurt and evil example of the rest of the country: Therefore the Generall

<p class="p1 center">Sess. 5. 28 Julii.</p>

<p>The brethren appoyntit of before for reviseing and putting in order of the
causes of the increase of Papistrie within this realme, and of the overtures for
remeiding and suppressing of the same, gave in the saids causes and remedies
thereof, of the quhilk the tenor <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The causes of the increase of Papistrie within this realme are thought either to
aryse of the pairt of the Ministrie, or else of wthers causes arysing from the
Ministrie: First, their negligence to see the youth in every paroche brought up
in the knowledge of the trewth by catechiseing, and careless to urge provision for
Schooles within their bounds.</p>

<p>Secondly, The rasche and sudden admissione of men to the ministrie that are
not able to withstand and convince the adversary in the dayes of apostacie.</p>

<p>Thirdly, The laike of care in ministers to mark the offences, viz. to consider the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_579"></a>[579]</span>
course of the enemie, and to discover and dilate Jesuites and traffiquers against
religione, and uthers pervertit be them.</p>

<p>Fourthlie, The distraction aryseing amang the ministrie, quhill as diversitie of
judgment hes drawne them unadvysedly to contrarietie of affectiones, breeding
carnall contentions among themselves.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Overtures for remeiding of the Causses forsaids.</p>

<p>First, That it be of new inactit, that all ministers examine young children of
the age of sax yeares, and try that they have the Lord’s Prayer, Beliefe, and Commandments,
in the quhilk their parents shall be halden to instruct them before
the saids years, together with some schort forme of grace before and after meat,
as also some schort morning and evening prayer, and againe, that their growth in
greater knowledge of religione be tryit, that afterwards it may please God to
grant increase of knowledge at the age of fyftein or saxtein years, they may be
admitted to the holy communione.</p>

<p>Secondlie, That the Apostles precept be remembrit;&mdash;Lay hands suddenly on
no man&mdash;And according to it, that for closeing of the doore upon the affectiones
of men, some longer tyme be ascryvit for admission of men to the ministrie; the
exception of rare gifts being reservit to the judgment of the Generall Assemblie.</p>

<p>Thirdly, That ministers quho shall be found after tryall to have delayit the
executione of discipline against Papists upon negligence&mdash;that is, either not beginning
proces, or, if it be begune, not ending the same within halfe ane year,
shall losse ane year’s stipend; and these that shall be fund to have done it upon
some corrupt favour, shall be simplie deposit.</p>

<p>Fourthly, That there be recommendit to the ministry ane holy caire mutually
to eschew offences, and follow peace and love, quherunto we are callit: the
meanes for removing of such offences is referrit to the Generall Assemblie.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Causes of the Growth of Papistrie as they are conceavit, aryseth of utheris.</p>

<p>First, The overseeing of Seminarie Priests and Jesuites to traffique within the
land, for perverting of such as hes not occasione to go out of the countrey, and
impunitie of such as hes receaved them,&mdash;as also, that liberty that evill disposed
persones, voyde of knowledge, hes taken of the injurie of tyme, to bring hame the
books of apostats and professit Papists.</p>

<p>2dly, The preferment of men suspect of religione to publick offices within
this realme.</p>

<p>3dly, The favour schawne be these that are in authoritie to traffiquers and
excommunicat Papists after they had been apprehendit and wardit, sic as the
Abbot of New Abbay and uther Mess Priests, dimittit as is thought out of ward,
not without reward and without all warrand of his Majestie, and presently tollerat
in the countrie without persute, quhilk hes not only wrought ane coldness
of religione in the hearts of many people, but also nourishit ane false opinione of
his Majestie, quhilk opinly bursts out in the mouths and speeches of many.</p>

<p>4thly, That qwheras Presbytries are proceeding in the triall of mess sayers and
messe hearers, impediment is made be the Lords of his Majestie’s Councill, either<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_580"></a>[580]</span>
by advocatione before the Lords, or dispensatione to such as are excommunicat,
or by contramanding the Presbyteries to desist under the paine of hornying; and
that the executione being producit against any persone before the judges, the same
is not regardit, but proces grantit unto him as if he were ane member of the kirk
not excommunicat.</p>

<p>5thly, The great libertie grantit to the subjects of this kingdome to repaire unto
such pairts qwhare nothing is taucht but defection from religion and treason
against lawfull princes, and no securitie taken for their constancie, and in speciall,
the sending of noblemen’s sonnes by such as are in authoritie, furth of the
land, by such convoy as may delyver them into the hands of Papists to be pervertit
in religione, qwhereupon many of them are become apostates.</p>

<p>Lastly, The want of preachers in many congregations in this land, so that in
ane province thirty-ane kirks are found to be vaickeand, and, in others, some
seventeen, as in Nyddesdale, and uthers throw many pairts of the land.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Overtures for remedieing the Causes forsaids.</p>

<p>First, That ane commissione be grantit be his Majestie to the Bischop of every
Synod with such well affected noblemen and gentlemen as the Commissioners of
the Generall Assemblie shall nominat, to apprehend traffiqueing Papists, Jesuites,
and Seminarie Priests that does haunt within their bounds, with power to charge
the receipters to make open dores and delyver them, under the paine of treasone.</p>

<p>Secondly, That his Majestie be humbly intreatit, that no Papists nor suspect of
Papistrie, beare charge in Councill, Sessione, Government of Townes, nor uther
Publick Offices; and if there be any in the estate presently quhom his Heines
knawes in his awne wisdome, to be men evil affectit towards religione, that his
Majestie wold take order therwith.</p>

<p>Thirdly, That his Majestie will give order for executione of his Heines lawes
against Papists and traffiquers with all rigour, and that no favour be grantit be
any officer of estate without his Majestie’s privitie, under the paines of incurring
his Majestie’s hiche displeasure; as also, that the Councill make no impediment
to the letters of hornying to discharge the proceeding of Presbytries against the
persones forsaids.</p>

<p>Fourthly, That Papists quho ance have been knawne professors of Papistrie,
and for eschewing of civill paines or hope of preferment, will abjure their religion,
that his Majestie will please to cause inact, that it shall not be lawfull to
such to injoy any office or honor in the Commonewealth, notwithstanding of their
oath and communicating, untill fyve yeares probatione had been taken of their
constancie and sinceritie in professing of the truth.</p>

<p>Fifthly, That the Act made at Bruntiland concerning the sonnes of noblemen
and uthers passing to uther countries be considerit and confirmit, quhereof the
tenor follows: Item, for eschewing farther evill quhilk might come to the estate
of Religione be the evill educatione of the youth furth of the country, it wold be
cravit of his Majestie and Secret Counsell, that sic noblemen and uthers as directs
ane pedagogue be knawne godly and of good religione, learnit and instructit in
the same, and approvit in his religione be the testimoniall of his Presbytrie;&mdash;that
their remaining furth of the countrey be in places qwher the Religione is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_581"></a>[581]</span>
presently profest, or at the leist qwhere there is no restraint of the same be the
cruelty of inquisitione;&mdash;that dureing the tyme of their absence they shall not
haunt any idolatrous exercise of religione, and such as hes not the moyen to sustaine
ane pedagogue with their sonnes forth of the countrey, that they send them
to such pairts quhere there is no restraint of religione; and in caice their sonnes,
after their departure out of the countrie, haunt these pairts where the profession
of the trew religione is restraint, that they find caution not to intertaine them:
And in caice any that passes furth of the countrie imbrace any uther religione
then that qwhilk is presently professit within this realme, and this to be ane exceptione
against their service of their brives, and at the tyme of admission of any
of them to any office or honors; and in caice any of their parents contraveen any
of the premisses, that they incurre such paine as his Majestie and Secret Councell
shall modifie, and that such as are already out of the countrey either be
callit back againe before ane day to be appoyntit be his Majestie and Secret
Councell, or else that their parents be subject to the lyke conditiones as is before
sett downe, with such other additions to be eikit be his Majestie as his Heines
shall think expedient; and in speciall, for better explanatione heirof, that at every
service of any man as air to his father or any his predicessors, he be not servit
be the Sheriff or any wther ordinar Judge to burgh or land, as air to his father
or any of his predicessors, butt the testimony of the Bishop or Moderator of the
Presbytrie quhare he dwells, beirand the confession of his faith and integritie of
religione presently profest within this realme.</p>

<p>Saxtly, That the sonnes of such noblemen as profess Papistrie be delyverit to
the custodie of uther their noble friends that are of religione, to be brought up
in the knawledge of the truth.</p>

<p>Seventhly, That the searchers of merchandise brocht hame from beyond sea,
be commandit to sease upon all books brocht hame, and put them to be tryit be
the ministrie of the Presbytrie unto the quhilk they arryve, and that all book-sellers
lykewise doe the same before they make open sale thereof, under the paine
of confiscatione.</p>

<p>Auchtlie, That excommunicat Papists, especially such as be of ranke, be apprehendit
and put in close ward, and none have accesse unto them except such
as are of religione presently profest.</p>

<p>Ninthly, That his Majestie give order for the down casting of Gicht’s chappell,
the house of John Cheine in Esselmonth, quho receipts all Jesuits and Seminarie
Priests.</p>

<p>Tenthly, That order be taken with the Pilgrimages, viz., the Chappell callit
Ordiquhill and the Chappell of Grace, and to ane well in the bounds of Enzie.</p>

<p>Eleventhlie, That such persons as are or shall be excommunicat and beares
publick office within this realme, and thereafter put to the horne, that they nor
their deputs shall bruik no office nor auctoritie under his Majestie efter their
denunciatione, but that his Majestie shall appoynt wthers in their rowmes to doe
and minister justice to his Majestie’s leidges.</p>

<p>Lastly, That his Majestie wald take order anent the planting of the Kirks that
are presently destitute of pastors, and in speciall the Kirks of the Chappell Royall.</p>

<p>Quhilks haill causes of increase of Papistrie within this realme, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_582"></a>[582]</span>
overtures for remeiding thereof, the Assemblie hes thought expedient that the
same be direct to his Majestie, with ane humble supplicatione, requesting his
Grace to take such order thereanent, as his Majestie shall think maist expedient
for repressing of Papistrie, and increase of the truth and light of the
gospell within this realme; quhereunto the Earle of Dumbar, his Majestie’s
Commissioner, with the remanent of the nobility presently conveint in this Assemblie,
hes promised to concurr: And therefore the Assemblie hes nominat,
and be thir presents nominats,</p>

<p><span class="transnote nowrap">{blank space}</span> Earle of Wigtoune, ArchBishop of Glasgow, <span class="transnote nowrap">{blank space}</span> Livingstoune of
Kylsith, Mr William Cowper, minister at Perth, James Nisbet, merchand in
Edinburgh, and Mr William Hart, of Presstoune, their very lawful Commissioners,
giving them thair full power to present the humble supplicatione of this
present Assemblie to his Majestie, together with the causes of increase of Papistrie,
and overtures for remeid thereof above rehearsit, desyrand them that
they wald maist humbly intreat his Majestie to consider of the same, and if his
Heines thocht expedient, to cause the same to be put to executione, and that
the rather because, that after the last conventione halden at Lynlithgow, quher
there was many good acts and constitutions sett downe and concludit, the Papists,
nevertheless, did most prowdly and contemptuously upbraid diverse of the
ministrie, menassing them that they or the nobilitie conveint with them at that
tyme, durst be bold to conclude any thing that might portend to the prejudice of
Papists or Papistrie, as was clearly understood be the brethren conveint in this
Assembly.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sess. 6, 29 Julii, Ante Meridiem.</p>

<p>The qwhilk day the Assemblie thocht expedient that the Commissioners above
specifeit, elect and chosen to present this supplicatione to his Majestie as is above
rehearsit, shall with all possible diligence repare toward his Majestie, and with all
humility present the said supplicatione to his Heines, and what ane answer it
shall please his Majestie to give, that they reporte the same betwixt and the 15 of
November nixt to come; and to that effect, the Assemblie hes chosen out of their
number the Noblemen, Barrons, and brethren underwritten, viz. Earles of Crawford,
Mortoune, Glencairn, Lithgow, Kinghorne, the Lords Grahame, Lyndsay,
Saltone, Lowatt, Torphichen, Lowdon, Scoone, Balcleuch, Blantyre, Halyrudehouse,
the Constable of Dundie, the Lairds of Kynnaird, Balvaird, Carnall,
Houstoune, Edmistoune, Broxmouth, Polwart, Sir John Hoome of Northberwick,&mdash;the

Wm. Methven, Patrick Schaw, Walter Stewart, Hew Fullertoune, James
M‘Quhorne, Thomas Ramsay, Robert Glendynning, together with the Commissioners

nixt to come, and there to receave from the saids Commissioners the report of his
Majestie’s most gracious answer to the supplicatione forsaid, in name of the haill
Assemblie; and in the meantyme, the Assemblie commands and ordaynes the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_583"></a>[583]</span>
haill Presbytries within this realme to proceed against Papists of all sorts within
their bounds with the censures of excommunicatione, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The said day, the Commissioners of the last Generall Assemblie being callit
to give compt of their haill proceeding since the last Assemblie, compeirit and
offerit themselves to be tryit on their proceedings be this present Assemblie, and
to abyde at the censure of the same; and being demandit for productione of
their acts and proceedings in wreit, declairit be the mouth of Mr John Hall,
their Moderator, in absence of Mr Patrick Galloway, that the same could not
be found, be reasone that sometyme umquhill Mr James Nicolsone, minister at
Meigle, and in his absence umquhill Richard Thomsone, minister at Cassiltoune,
were ordinar scribes and keepers of the rolls of all their proceedings, quha are
both departit this lyfe; and albeit they have made travell at their executors hands
for obtaining of the said scrolls, yet they could on no wayes attain unto the
same&mdash;and therefore they and every ane of them did offer themselves to be particularlie
censurit be this present Assemblie, and therefore being ordaynit all to
remove; qwhilk being done, Mr W<sup>m</sup>. Cowper, Moderator, appoyntit to this
effect, demandit publickly if any of the Assemblie had aught to object against
the saids Commissioners proceedings why the samen sould not be ratified and
allowit? In respect of the taciturnitie of the haill brethren, and that nothing
worthy of censure was objectit to any of them for their proceedings,&mdash;the saids
Commissioners being receivit in the Assemblie, took instruments of the ratificatione
and allowance of their saids proceedings.</p>

<p>The said day, the brethren of the Generall Assemblie presently convenit, having
advisedly considerit the necessitie of electing and chuseing Commissioners from this
present Assemblie for giving advice to his Majestie anent the suppression of papisticall
superstition qwhilk increases mair and mair dayly within this realme;
therefore they have made, and constitute, and ordaynit, likeas they, be the tenor

this present Assemblie; givand, grantand, and committand unto them, or any elevin
as said is, their full power to plant such kirks in burrowtownes as presently are
or shall be found destitute of pastors, before the next Assemblie. Attour, if it
shall happen the King’s Majestie to be grievit at ony of the ministry for qwhatsoever
enormitie committit be them against his Heines, with power to them, or any

redresse of the samen; ordayning them to give accompt of their proceedinge to
the next Generall Assemblie quhen it shall happen to conveine, &amp;c. It is alwayes
speciallie provydit, that this present nominatione of the same Commissioners
quhilk were for the most part Commissioners in the last Assemblie, shall
no wayes be prejudiciall to the Assemblie’s liberty in choising and electing Commissioners
quhom they shall think most meit and expedient, neither shall this
election indure or import any perpetuity of the office in the persone of the persones
electit.&mdash;<em>Item</em>, It is statute that the haill Commissioners be desyrit and
warnit to keep all their conventiones is opportunitie the same day may be done.</p>

<p>Forsuameikle as the distractiones and eyelists quhilks are suspectit to be in
the hearts of the brethren among themselves, is one of the maist speciall and urgent
causes of the increase of Papists and Papistrie within this realme: Therefore,
for avoyding thereof, that certain of the brethren, viz., The Bischops of St
Androis, Ross, Glasgow, Orknay, Mrs John Hall, Patrick Simsone, Wm.
Cowper, and John Knox, conveine with his Majestie’s Commissioners to advyse
upon the most solide and substantious overture for removeing of the saids eylists
and distractiones, and to reporte the same to the Assemblie the next Sessione.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sess. 7. Julii 29.</p>

<p>The said day the brethren appoyntit for advysing upon the best overtures
anent the distractiones and eylists that were enterit in the hearts of the ministry
declarit, that after mature deliberatione they fand the saids eylists and controversies
to aryse either upon distractions of affectiones, or else diversitie of opiniones,
the first whereof being carnall, and therefore more dangerous, because
it sufferit not the brethren quhais affections were separate to unite themselves
with efald and uniforme counsell and advyce, to resist the subtill practises of the
common enemie, and so give him place with his subtill crafts to enter in the
Kirk of God, and thereby to supplant and undermyne the same; Therefore
their advyce was, that as the danger increases be the nourisching of the distracted
affections of the brethren, even so the cure was the more necessary, and
the more hastily to be applyit, to wit, That the haill brethren of the ministrie
sould presently, in the fear of God, lay down all rancour and distractione of
hearts and affectiones, quhilk either of them hes borne against uthers in all
tymes bypast, and be reconcilit in the heartie affectione in Christ, as becomes
them quho are ministers of the word of God, and preachers of peace, Christian
love and charitie to his people, to the effect that this heartie reconciliatione, their
hearts and advyce may be conciliat for disappoynting of the crafty devyse of
the enemy. Quhilk advyce the haill brethrene of the Assemblie maist willinglie
and heartilie imbraced, and ordained every ane of them, alsweill Commissioners
present as of the ministry that were absent, to obey the same, by laying downe
and casting away all grudge or rancour that any of the brethrene bear at uthers;
in token qwhereof, and of an efauld union of hearts and affections, they all held
up their hands to God, testifying to his Majestie the truth of their hearts in the
said matter; and lykewayes they ordaynit the same to be intimat to the rest of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_585"></a>[585]</span>
the brethren at their returning to their Presbytries, to the effect the same may be
done in every Presbytrie immediately after their returning, as said is&mdash;inhibiting
also and dischargeing any such distractions or rancours to be among them, either
in affectione, word, deed, or countenance, but that they concurre in ane mutuall
friendship and amitie in God, as becomes the pastors of the Kirk of Christ; and
qwhosoever does in the contrair, that he be censurit in his awne Presbytrie or
Synod,&mdash;and in caice of negligence, the Commissioners of the Assemblie.</p>

<p>As for the second cause of eylists, qwhilk is said to aryse upon diversitie of
opiniones, because these diversities of opinions results upon different judgements
amongst the brethren, concerning the externall government and discipline of the
Kirk, qwhilk cannot so schortly be discussit and advysit upon as the brevitie
of this Assemblie permitts: therefore it was the opinion of the brethren forsaid
that the same sould be delayit to ane tyme mair convenient: and in
the meantyme, certaine appoyntit to reasone, intreat, and advyse upon the same,
quhilk lykeways the Assemblie hes thocht expedient&mdash;and, therefore, they have
electit and chosen the brethren after following, viz. The Bischops of St Androis,
Glasgow, Dunkeld, Orknay, Cathnes, M<sup>r</sup> Patrick Scharpe, Robert Howie, John
Mitchellsone, Henry Philip, George Hay, Patrick Galloway, John Hall, Patrick
Simsone, W<sup>m</sup>. Scott, Archbald Oswall, John Knox, John Carmichaell, Adam
Ballantyne, John Weems, and W<sup>m</sup>. Cowper, their Commissioners in that part, to
convein with his Majestie’s Councill as his Hienes shall appoynt, at such tyme
and place as they shall be requyrit be his Majestie, and to treat, reasone, and
consult upon all matters standing presently among the brethren anent the discipline
of the Kirk, and quhatsoever they agree upon to report to the nixt Generall
Assemblie. And, in the meantyme, quhill the nixt Assemblie, for an
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">interim</i>, the advyce of the brethren convenit at Falkland the 16 of Junii last, be
observit anent the constant Moderator.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, It is statute and ordaynit, that as upon every fifth day of August, publick
thanksgiving is given to God for preservatione of his Majestie from the
treasone of sometyme John Earle of Gowrie throughout all the pairts of Great
Brittaine, and that the same be intimate at every paroche Kirk with all possible
diligence; ordayning that such as refuses to doe the same, be observit and delait
to the Commissioners of the Generall Assemblie.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, Because the brethren appoyntit for tryell of the diligence of the Commissioners
appoyntit be the last Generall Assemblie for visitatione of the Presbytries
and report, that it was ane generall grief and complaint given in be the
few commissioners that had producit their diligence of the great desolatione of
the want of pastors, and in speciall of the farthest of the North and South partes;
therefore the brethren ordaint the commissioners of this present Assemblie to
direct ane supplicatione to his Majestie for taking order for planting of the kirks
within this realme; and in respect of the great necessitie of the kirks of Annandale,
Ewisdale, and Eskdale, and the rest of the kirks of the daills quhilks are
altogether unplantit, as likewayes, the kirks of Cathnes and Ross, in the quhilks
it is regraited that in many of them the holy communione was never celebrate:
Therefore the Assemblie hes given and grantit, likeas they be the tennor heirof
gives and grants their full power and commission to their brethren underwritten,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_586"></a>[586]</span>
viz., to the Bischop of Glasgow and Mr John Knox, for visitatione of the kirks
of Annandaill, Evisdaill, and Eskdaill, and remanent daills unplantit as said is,
and to the Bischop of Caithnes, George Dowglass, and Mr Wm. Dowglass, for
visitatione of the kirks of Caithnes and Rosse, with power to them to plant
ministers at the kirks within the saids bounds respective, and to try the literature,
qualificatione, and conversatione of such as are already plantit, and in caise of
insufficiency to depryve them from their functione; with power also to cause
kirks be re-edified quher as they are demolisched, and if need beis to unite kirks
qwher necessitie requires, and to report their diligence to the nixt Assemblie&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">promitten

<p class="p1 center">Sessio Ultima. Penultimo die Julii, Ante Meridiem.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, Because ane great part of the desolatione of kirks proceeds from the
absence of certaine of the ministry from their flocks, be reasone they are so confynit,
therefore the Assemblie hes thocht it expedient that the Commissioners
direct ane humble supplicatione to his Majestie, most humbly desyrand his
Hienes to sett at libertie such of the ministrie as are confynit, to the effect be
their presence and awayting on their cure their flocks may be comforted, qwhilks
are now left desolate.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, Because it is humbly lamentit that the inhabitants of the towne of
Aberdeene ceases not yearly to elect and chuse such persones to be magistrats
and upon their counsell as are wilfull and profest Papists, and enemies to the
truth profest within this realme, to the dishonour of God, and dishearting of
such as feares his name, and contempt of discipline within that burgh; Therefore
it is ordaynit be the Assemblie that the Presbytrie of Aberdeene inhibit the
Councill and inhabitants of the said burgh, that they elect nor chuse no Papists
to beare office of ane magistrate or upon councill in no tyme coming, and if they
doe in the contrare, that they proceed against them with the censures of the
Kirk; Ordayning lykewayes the Commissioners appoyntit for his Majestie to
adjoyne this petitione to the rest of their supplicationes, that by his royal authority,
ane civill paine may be imponit upon the contraveeners of the said act.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, It is ordaynit that no minister in ony tyme coming, take upon hand to
solist in favour of Papists or suspect of Papistrie, either before the civill or spirituall
Judge or utherwayes, either be word or wreit, under the pain of deprivatione.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, Because there is sundrie supplicationes given in to the Generall Assemblie
quhilk, for the schortness of tyme, cannot be decydit and answerit; therefore
the Generall Assemblie remitts the same to their Commissioners above constitute,
ordayning them to conveen upon the 15 of Nov. nixt to come, and there
to decyde and answer all such bills and supplicationes as shall be direct unto
them upon the back from this present Assemblie.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, Because it hath pleasit God of his mercy to grant ane good and happy
successe to this present Conventione, to the comfort of his awne Kirk and discontentment
of his enemies; therefore the Assemblie ordaynes the same to be
intimate be every Presbytrie at their severall paroche Kirks immediately after the
dissolving of this Conventione, and that they give publick thanks for the same,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_587"></a>[587]</span>
and pray God for a prosperous and a lang reigne to his Majestie and the health
of his Royall posteritie.</p>

<p>The next Generall Assemblie is ordaynit to hald at Edinburgh the last Twesday
of May 1609 years, if his Majestie shall think expedient.</p>

<p>Thanks being given to God for the prosperous event of this Assemblie be
prayer and singing of psalmes, the same was dismissit.</p>

</div>

<p>In the first, it is declarit that the allegit Assemblie haldin at Aberdeen is null
in the self, speciall in respect it had not his Majestie’s allowance, and was dischargit
be his Majestie’s Commissioner.</p>

<p>And because necessitie of the Kirk craves that for order taken with the common
enemie and uther affaires of the Kirk, there shall be yearly Generall Assemblies,
the condition whereof the Assemblie acknowledges to appertayne to his
Majestie be the prerogative of his royall crowne; and, therefore, the Generall
Assemblie maist humbly requests his Majestie, that Generall Assemblies be halden
ance in the year, or at the liest, in respect of the necessitie forsaid, that his Majestie
wold appoynt ane certaine tyme at the quhilk the samen shall be halden
precisely in all tyme coming.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, It is thocht expedient that the Bischops shall be Moderators in every

<p><em>Item</em>, That no sentence of excommunicatione or absolutione therefra be pronuncit
againes or in favours of any persone without the knowledge and approbatione
of the Bischop of the diocie, quho most be answerable to his Majestie for
all formall and impartiall proceedings therein; and the proces being found formall,
the sentence to be pronuncit at the directione of the Bischop, be the minister of
the paroche quhere the offender dwells and their proces began.</p>

<p>And in caice the Bischop shall be found to have stayed the pronuncing of the
sentence against any persone that hes merite the same, and against quhom the
proces has been lawfully deducit, that advertisement shall be made to his Majestie
to the effect ane uther may be placit in his rowme.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, That all presentationes heirafter be direct to the Bischop; and upon any
presentatione given or utherwayes sute made be any to be admittit to the ministry,
the Bischop is to requyre the ministry of these bounds qwhere he is to serve,
to certifie by their testificat unto him of the partie suiter, his conversatione past,

<p>I, A. B., now nominat and admittit to the G. of K., utterly testifies and declares
on my conscience, that the richt excellent, richt hiche and mighty Prince
James the Sixt, be the grace of God King of Scotts, is the only lawfull, supreame
governour of this realme, alsewell in things temporall as in conservatione and
purgatione of religione, and that no forraigne Prince, Prelat, nor Potentate, hes
or oucht to have jurisdictione, power, superioritie, preheminence or authority,
ecclesiasticall and spirituall, within this realme; and therefore I utterly renunce
and forsake all forraine jurisdictiones, powers, superiorities, auctoritie, and promises;
that from this furth, I shall and will bear faith and trew alleadgeance to
his Hienes, his airs, and lawful successors, and to my power shall assist and
defend all jurisdictions, priviledges, preheminences, and auctorities grantit and

unto his Hienes in your presence, and to his Majestie, his aires, and lawful
successors, shall be faithful and trew: Swa help me God.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, The visitatione of ilk diocie is to be done be the Bischop himselfe; and
if the bounds shall be greater than he can overtake, he is then to make speciall
choyce, and to appoynt some worthy men to be visitors in his place; and quhatever

<p><em>Item</em>, That no Bischop be electit but who hes past the age of fourty years

nixt to come, therefore it is ordaynit, that in absence of the Bischope, ane
constant Moderator shall remaine in their owne places qwhill the next Synod be
holden in October.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, Because it is uncivill that laws and constitutions, either civill or ecclesiasticall,
being ance established, and in force by publick opinion and consent,
should be controllit and callit in question be any persone, therefore it is statute
by uniforme consent of this haill Assemblie, that none of the ministry, either in

<p class="p1 center">Sess. 2<sup>a</sup>. August 14.</p>

<p>Forsuameikle as the maist urgent causes of the convocation of this present Assemblie
is to obviat the great increase of Papistrie within this realme, and to try
out the just causes thereof, to the effect that sufficient remedies may be provydit
for redressing of the same in all tyme coming, and that it is found be the haill
Assemblie that ane great part of the causes of the increase forsaid relyes presently
upon the slackness of the ministers in their holy profession, and pairtly upon the
not executing of the lawes, alsewell civill as ecclesiasticall, against such persones
as either were excommunicat themselves, and openly continuit the said censure,
or qwho intertaines, receiptes, and maintains qwha are excommunicat, or qwho
were the traffiquers against the trew religione presently profest within this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_590"></a>[590]</span>
realme: For remeid qwhereof the whole Assemblie in ane voyce hes statute and
ordaynit in manner after following:</p>

<p>In the first, for the better tryall and discovering of Apostates, It is statute and
ordainit that qwhosoever hes confessit the trew religion presently profest within
this realme, and hes subscrivit the same, and has receavit the holy communion of
the Supper of the Lord, and communicat conforme to the order prescryvit within
this realme, if at any tyme hereafter he or she be found in any tyme either to
reasone or gainstand the trew religione presently profest within this realme, or
any particular head thereof, or to raill against the same, or else directly or indirectly
to be a seducer or perverter of others from the said truth presently profest
as said is, or if he or she be found to resett or intertaine any traffiquing Papists,
Jesuites, or Seminarie Priests; any one of the said facts or deeds shall be ane
sufficient cause of apostacie, and these doers shall be repute and punischit as
apostates; and because the probatione in the saids causes is difficile and almost
impossible, in respect that the said deeds are committit covertly and quherin probatione
hardly can be producit; therefore it is statute, that in caise their probatione
cannot be had, that it shall be lawfull to prove the same be the oath of the
pairtie alleadgit committer of the saids facts and deeds, and that it shall not be
lesum to him to refuse to give his oath in the saids matter, upon whatsomever
collour or pretence of criminall action or wthers following thereupon; and to
this effect that ane supplicatione be direct to his Majestie, that it might please
his Hienes to sett downe ane ordinance for ratificatione of the former statute, to
the effect it may be receavit in all judicatories.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, It is statute, if any persone or persones quho hes conformit himself to
the trew religione presently profest within this realme, and hes subscryvit the
Confession of the Faith and receavit the Communion, if in any tyme hereafter
he or they doe not haunt the ordinare exercises of religione, being admonisched
be their ordinare Pastor <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trina admonitione</i>, the same being proven shall be ane
cause to punische them as held and repute apostates.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, It is statute and ordainit, that qwhatsoever persone, knowne of before
tyme to have been a Papist, and after reconciling to the Church, he shall be tryit
and found to weare and beare under persone <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agnus Dei</i> beads, cross, crucifixes,
or to have uther house idols or images, or in their books such things as before
they have superstitiously used, the same shall inferr just suspicione of apostacie
and falling back; and they being convict thereof, shall be halden and repute as
apostats.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, It is statute and ordainit, that qwhensoever any minister shall receave any
Papist returning from his errors to the bosom of the Kirk, that at the tyme of his
receaving, the minister shall first take his oath solemnlie sworne, that he shall declare
the verity of his fayth and belief in every particular poynt and article contayning
the Confessione of the Faith qwhilk shall be speirit at him, and that immediatly
the said minister shall examine him particularly upon every head contained
in the said Confessione of Fayth, and receave his particular answer thereupon
<em>affirmative</em> conforme to the same, utherwayes he shall not be receavit.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, It is statute anent the wyfes of noblemen and wthers qwho receipts traffiquing
Papists, Jesuites, Seminarie Priests, and if the same were done against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_591"></a>[591]</span>
the will and knowledge of their husbands, that all such women shall be callit and
convenit for the said receipt and intertainment; and their being convict therefore,
they shall be wardit ay and qwhill they finde sufficient cautione to abstaine from
the lyke in all tyme coming under a certaine paine, but prejudice of any actione
that may be competent against their husbands, conform to the lawes of this realme.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, Because the speciall cause of increase of Papistrie proceeds upon the
not putting to executione of the statutes and acts of Parliament made against
traffiqueing Papists, or Seminarie Priests, that therefor an applicatione be directed
to his Majestie, that it will please his Hienes to take such order that the lovable
laws and acts of Parliament made be his Majestie in tymes bypast against traffiqueing
Papists, Jesuites, or Seminarie Priests, may be put to executione in
tyme coming with rigour.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, It is statute that the haill names of Papists recusants, within this
realme, be given in be the Commissioners of this present Assemblie, to the clerk,
to be delyverit be him to the Archbischops of St Androis and Glasgow, conforme
to their severall provinces, to the effect they may be callit and conveinit before
them in the hie commission, and punisched as accords; but prejudice alwayes of
uther ecclesiasticall censure and discipline of the Kirk statute against them of
before.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, It is ordaynit that every ane of the ministry give up the names of such
of their paroche as hes past furth of the cuntrie, and not found caution for
their behaviour and sincere professione of the trew religione furth of the samen,
conforme to the act of Parliament, to the effect they may be callit, convenit, and
punishit therefore.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, It is statute that the haill names of the persons excommunicat within
this realme quhilk shall be given up be the Commissioners, be delyverit to the
Bischope of every diocie, quho shall delyver a catalogue of the names to every
minister within his diocie, ordayning every minister to make publick intimatione
thereof at every ane of their paroche kirkes, upon Sunday, in tyme of divyne
service, that no man pretend ignorance of the same; charging and inhibiting
every one of their paroche, that they neither receipt the saids excommunicants
nor intercommon with them; certifying them and they doe in the contrare, they
shall be callit and conveinit as receipters of traffiqueing Papists and excommunicat
persones, and punisched for the same.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, The Assemblie recommends to the care of Bischops within their dioces,
and Ministers within their congregationes, to travell with the noblemen, gentlemen,
and burgesses, that there be the ordinarie exercise of reading and prayer
within their houses, as also ane prayer for the King’s Majestie and his children
every meal.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sess. 15.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> August 15, 1616.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, Because there are some pamphlets and books full of calumnies quyetly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_592"></a>[592]</span>
sett furth and spread within this countrie be the Papists and enemies of trew
religion; therefore the Assemblie hes ordaynit Mr Wm. Scott, minister at Cowper,
and Mr William Struthers, minister at Edinburgh, shall make answers to the
said books and pamphlets, to the effect that thereby the people may be instructit
how to beware of the same, and the said errors and calumnies may be refutit.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, Because it is certainly informit that certaine women tacks upon them to
bring up the youth in reading, sewing, and wthers exercises in schools, under
pretext and cullour quherof traffiquing Papists, Jesuites, and Seminarie Priests,
hes their appoyntit tymes of meeting, at the quhilk tyme they catechise and pervert
the youth in their growing and tender age, in such sort that heirby thereafter,
by great paines and travells, can they be brocht from their errors to the
acknowledging of the truth presently profest within this realme: It is therefore
statute and ordaint that it shall not be leisume to quhatsoever persone or persones
to hold any schools for teaching of the youth, except, first, they have the
approbation of the Bischop of the diocie, and be first tryit be the Ministers of the
Presbytry quhere they dwell, and have their approbatione to the effect forsaid.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, Because it is ane great abuse in people passing to pilgrimages, wells, and
old chapells, as lykewayes in putting up of banefyres; Therefore it is ordaint
that the brethren of the ministry be diligent in teaching of the people and
preaching against such abuses and superstitione, to the effect they may be recallit
from the saids errors, and lykewayes that the minister take diligent tryall
of the names of those quho haunts those pilgrimages, and delait the same to the
Archbischopes of St Androis and Glasgow, every ane within their owne provinces,
to the effect they may be callit before the Commission and punischit for
the same.</p>

<p>It is lykewayes ordaynit that their names be delyverit to the Justices of Peace
within the places of their pilgrimages and dayes of their meetings, and that they
be requestit and desyrit to attend upon the saides dayes of their meetings, and to
disturbe and divert them therefrom be apprehending and punisching them.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, It is ordaynit that every minister give up the names of idle sangsters
within their paroche to the Justices of Peace, that they may be callit and convenit
before them and punischit as idle vagabonds, conforme to the Acts of Parliament
and power given to the saids Justices thereanent.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, Because it is found that diverse of the saids Jesuites, traffiquing Papists,
and Seminarie Priests, goes about under collour and pretext of Doctors of Physicke
and Apothecaries, deceaving and perverting the people from the trew religione
profest within this countrie; Therefore ane supplicatione wald be direct to
his Majestie, that it wald please his Hienes to statute and ordayne that none hereafter
be sufferit to wse and exerce the office of ane Doctor of Physicke or Apothecar
whill first he have ane approbatione from the Bischop of the dioces qwhere
he maks his residence, of his conformity in religione, as lykewayes from the
Universitie qwhere he learnit and studyit, of his qualificatione in the said airt.</p>

<p>The qwhilk day appearit in presence of the haill Assemblie, John Gordoune of

<p>Here to insert the two letters quhilk is to be found afterward.*<a id="FNanchor_56a" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>With the quhilk the Assemblie being ryplie advysit, hes thocht it maist expedient
that the said Marquess compeir in presence of the whole Assemblie, there
to testifie his conformitie in the poynts of religione, and resolutione to abyde
thereat, and so to be absolvit from the sentence of excommunicatione pronuncit
against him; and therefor ordaines the said John Gordoune of Buckie to advertise
the said Lord Marques, that he compear before the Assemblie upon Wednesday
nixt to come, the 21 of August instant, to the effect forsaid; and for the
better furtherance heirof, the Assemblie hes desyrit the Lord Commissioner and
Lord Archbishop Moderator, to write thir letters to the said Lord Marques for
the causes forsaids.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sess. August 16, 1616.</p>

<p>The quhilk day, the Lord Commissioner for his Majestie producit certain instructiones
direct be his Majestie to the said Lord Commissioner to be preponit
to this present Assemblie anent the provisione of the remedie for the defectione
and falling away of many from the truth, quhereof the tenor followeth:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Instructions to the richt trusty and well-beloved Cowsing and Counsellor
the Earle of Montrose.&mdash;Here to be insert.*<a id="FNanchor_56b" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Qwhilk being read in audience of the haill Assemblie, they most humbly thanked
his Majestie for the great care and solicitude his Majestie alwayes tooke for the
advancement of the glory of God and professione of the trew religione within this
realme, and holding downe and suppressing of papistrie and superstitione within
the same; and as to the said instructions, the brethren were ordaynit to advyse
therewith qwhill the morne.</p>


<p class="p1 center">Sess. August 17, 1616.</p>

<p>Anent the said instructiones direct from his Majestie to this Assemblie, the
said Assemblie being rypelie advysit therewith, hes statute and ordaynit as followeth:</p>

<p>In the first, concernying the cause and defectione of many from the trew religione
in this kingdome, and the remedies thereof, the Assemblie hes set them
down in the articles made before in this present conventione; and therefore most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_594"></a>[594]</span>
humbly desyres his Majestie to confirme and allow them, and make them receave
executione.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, Because the laicke of competent maintenance to ministers is the chief
cause of the evill qwhilk lyes upon this kirk, qwhilk for the maist pairt proceeds
from the dilapidatione of benefices; to the effect therefore that the progress of
that evill may be stayit, and some meines devysit to recover that qwhilk by iniquitie
of tyme has been losit, the Assemblie remitts the tryall, cognitione, and
whole dispositione of this matter to the Commissioners appoyntit from this Assemblie
for the causes underwritten. And in the meintyme, inhibits and discharges
all ministers who are beneficit persones, and uthers that are members of
any chapter, to sett in tack and assedatione, any pairt of their benefices, either in
long or schort tackes, to qwhatsoever persone or persones, or as members of chaptor
to give their consentes to any tackes or assedationes sett be uthers, qwhill
the saids Commissioners have conveinit and taken order anent dilapidatione of
benefices and forme and manner of setting of tacks, under the paine of excommunicatione
of the persons setters of the saids tacks and consenters thereto, and
deprivatione of them from their benefices.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, Because the provisione of learnit, wyse, and peaceable men to be ministers
at chief Burrowtownes in vaickand places, such as Edinburgh, Perth,
Aberdeene, Bamff, and uther places vaickand, is ane most effectuall meane to
root out Poprie and perpetuat the trew professione of religione; it is therefore ordaynit
that the burrowtowns be provydit with the most learnit, wyse, and peaceable
men that may be had; and because the commissioners of the towne of Edinburgh
hes no commission from the said toune anent the provisione of ministers
to the vaickand places within their said kirk, therefore the care thereof is committit
to the saids commissioners, to quhom it shall be injoynit in their commission,
that they sie the same performit; and as to Perth, the Assemblie ordaynes my
Lord Bischop of Galloway to deall with the Commissioners of the towne of
Perth for provisione of that vaickand place; and sicklyke ordaynes the Provost of
Aberdeene to advyse with the counsell anent the planting of the said kirk, to the
effect sufficient and qualified men may be nominat and provydit to the saids
places before the dissolving of this present Assemblie.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, Because ane speciall care should be had of the places of noblemen their
residence, chiefly of such as were thoucht to inclyne to Poprie; therefore the Assemblie
statutes and ordaynes, that the Lords Archbischops and Bischops, with
the advyce of their Synods, take care that most learnit and discreet persones of
the ministrie be appoyntit to attend the saids places, and be transportit thereto,
sic as the kirks of Bellie, North Berwick, Cockburnespath, Paslay, and wthers
places quhere noblemen make residence, chiefly those quho are thought to inclyne
to Poprie, and that they have a care of their maintainance and sufficient provisione;
and if the same be small, that these that are appoyntit to attend at the
saids kirks carie their livings and rents with them quhill farther order be taken.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, Forsuameikle as ane of the maist speciall means for staying the increase
of Poperie, and settleing of the trew religione in the hearts of the people, is, that
ane speciall care may be taken in the tryell of young children, their education,
and how they are catechisit, qwhilk in the meantyme of the primitive church was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_595"></a>[595]</span>
most carefully attendit, as one of the most effectuall meanes to cause young
children in their tender years drink in the trew knowledge of God and his
religione, but is now altogether neglected in respect of the great abuse and
errors quhilks creip in into the Popishe church, upon the said good ground he
bigging thereupone ane Sacrament of confirmatione; therefore, to the intent that
all errors and superstitione quhilk hes been biggit upon the said ground may be
rescindit and taken away, that the matter itself being most necessar for educatione
of youth may be reducit to its owne integritie:</p>

<p>It is statute and ordaynit that the Archbishop and Bischops in the visitatione
of the kirks, either be themselves, or qwhene they cannot overtake the bussiness,
the minister of the paroche, make all young children of such yeares of age be
presentit before them, and to give confession of the faith, that so it may appear
in quhat religion they have bein traynit up, and that they be commendit to God
by prayer at the tyme, for the increase of knowledge and continwance of his
grace with them after that tryall; that the minister of the paroche, every two or
three years, ance at the least, re-examine them, that after sufficient growth in
knowledge they may be admittit to the holy communione; and it is desyrit that
ane supplicatione be direct to the King’s Majestie, humbly craving that it wold
please his Hienes to injoyne ane punischment upon such parties as either do not
present their children, or shall be found negligent in their right instruction, and
that they be callit and convenit therefore before the High Commission.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, It is statute that the simple professione of the faith underwritten be
universally receavit throughout this whole kingdome, to the qwhilk all hereafter
shall be bound to swear and sett their hands; and in speciall all persones that
bear office in the Church, at their acceptatione of any of the saids offices, and
lykewayes Students and Schollars; of the qwhilk Confessione the tenor <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><em>Item</em>, It is statute and ordaynit that a Catechisme be made, easie, short, and

before the communione: and for the better effectuating heirof, the Assemblie
hes ordaint Mr Pat. Galloway and Mr John Hall, ministers at Edinburgh, and
Mr John Adamsone, minister at Libbertone, to forme the said Catechisme, and
to have the same in readiness before the first day of October nixt to come, to the
effect the same may be allowit and printed with the King’s Majestie’s licence;
the qwhilk Catechisme being so printed, it is statute and ordainit that no uther
hereafter be printed within this realme, nor used in families for instruction and
examinatione of their bairnes, servants, nor the people, in all tyme coming.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, It is statute and ordaynit that ane uniforme order of Lyturgie or Divine
Service be sett doune to be read in all Kirks on the ordinarie dayes of prayer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_596"></a>[596]</span>
and every Sabbath day before the sermone, to the end the common people may
be acquainted therewith, and by custome may learne to serve God rightlie: and
to this intent, the Assemblie hes appoyntit the saids Mr Patrick Galloway, Mr
Peter Elliot, Mr John Adamsone, and Mr W<sup>m</sup>. Erskine, minister at <span class="transnote nowrap">{blank space}</span>,
to revise the Book of Common Prayers contenit in the Psalme Book, and to sett
doune ane common forme of ordinary service to be used in all tyme hereafter,
quhilk shall be usit in all tyme of common prayers in all Kirks quhere there is
exercise of common prayers, as lykewise be the minister before the sermone quhere
there is no reader.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, It is statute and ordaynit that in all tyme hereafter, the holy Communion
be celebrate in all Kirks within this realme at the tymes following, viz. in Burrowtownes,

as landwart shall be at the tyme of Eister yearly; and if any persone shall not
communicat ance in the year at ane of the foresaid tymes, that it shall be humbly
requyrit of his Majestie that the penaltie of the Act of Parliament may be exactit
of such persones with all rigour.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, It is thoucht most necessare and expedient that there be ane uniformitie
of Church discipline throughout the whole Kirks of this Kingdome; and to that
effect it is statute and ordaynit that a Book of Cannons be made, published in
wreit drawn furth of the Books of formall Assemblies, and quhare the same is
defective that it be supplied be the Cannons of Counsell and Ecclesiasticall Conventiones
in former tyme, the caire quherof the Assemblie be thir presents committs
to the Richt Reverend James Archbishop of Glasgow, and W<sup>m</sup>. Struthers,
minister at Edinburgh, quho shall put in forme the said Ecclesiasticall Cannons,
and present them to the Commissioners appoyntit be this Assemblie; to quhom

to supplicat to his Majestie that the same may be ratified and approved by his
Royal authoritie, with priviledge to put the same in print.</p>

the light of the Gospell with ages to come, the Divinitie Colledge foundit at
St Androis, quhilk sould be the seminarie of the Kirk within this realme, be

rent thereof is meine for the present, it is ordaynit that for the provisione of some
students in divinitie every diocie shall intertaine two, or according to the quantitie
of the dioces so many, as the number may aryse to twenty-sax in haill&mdash;respect
being had to the mienness of some diocies, and greatness and powers of
wthers, so that the leist diocies in their contributione shall be helpit and easit be
the greater: in the qwhilk number it is ordaynit that the halfe at the leist be the
sonnes of poor ministers, and be presentit be the Bischops of the diocies to the
place.</p>

<p><em>Item</em>, The Assemblie ratifies and approves the former Act made in the Assemblie
holdin at Halyrudehouse the tenth day of November 1602 anent the sacrament
of baptisme, that the same be not refusit if the parent crave the same, be
giving ane Christian confessione of his fayth upon any uther particular pretence

<p class="p1 center"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acta Sessione Ultima.</i></p>

<p>The quhilk day, in presence of the whole Assemblie, compeirit the noble and
potent Lord, George Marques of Huntlie, and declareit that he had direct before,
John Gordoune of Buckie to present his supplicatione to this present Assemblie,
quhereof the tenor is insert before: Lykeas of new, he reiterat the said supplicatione,
declaring the sorrow and grieff he had conceivit, in that he had lyen so long
under the fearfull sentence of excommunicatione, and, therefore, most humbly
desyrit to be absolvit from the same, as he faithfully promised in face of the haill
Assemblie to performe and fulfill the conditiones and heads under specifeit, viz.:</p>

<p>First, The said noble Lord faithfully promised before God, his hand holden
up, to professe and abyde be the trew religion presently profest within this realme,
and allowit be the lawes and acts of Parliament within the same.</p>

<p>2. He faithfully promised to communicat at the first occasione he should be
requyrit, and so to continow, conforme to the order of the land.</p>

<p>3. He should cause his children, servants, and whole domesticks, be obedient
to the Kirk and discipline thereof, and sould cause them haunt the kirk at ordinar
tymes of preaching.</p>

<p>4. He shall not receave Papists, Jesuites, Seminarie Priests, in his house, nor
nane of his lands, but put them out of his bounds with all diligence.</p>

<p>5. He allows the Confessione of the Faith presently sett downe be the said
Assemblie; and in token of his constant confessione thereof, he hes subscrivit the
samen in face of the Assembly.</p>

<p>Qwhilks haill premisses above specifeit the said noble Lord protests and declares
that he hes made and subscrivit truely and with ane honest heart, butt any
equivocatione, mentall reservatione, or subterfuge qwhatsoever, devysit be the
Romish Kirk and their supposts. Attour, the said noble Lord faithfully promised
to plant his whole kirks qwhereof his Lordship hes the teinds in tack positiones
or utherwayes, at the sicht and conclusione of my Lord Archbischop of St
Androis, the Bischop of Murray, and the Laird of Corse, unto qwhois modificatione
the said noble Lord submitts himself; be the tennor of thir presents, givand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_598"></a>[598]</span>

of St Androis, moderator, in face of the Assemblie, absolves the said George
Marques of Huntlie from the said sentence, led and deducit against him, and
receavit him againe into the bosome of the Church.</p>

<p>The quhilk day, the Generall Assemblie of the Kirke of Scotland presently
convenit, having interest in consideratione of the cause of the defection and falling
away of many from the trew religione, and having found the laike of the competent
maintainance to ministers not to be the leist cause of the evills quhilks
lyes upon the Kirke presently, the ground and fundament quhairof for the maist
pairt hes proceedit from the dilapidatione of benefices, with the quhilk, if some
solide order be not taken in tyme, the same is apparent to bring furth greater
evill and desolatione in this Kirke: And seeing the King’s Majestie hes requyrit
that order may be taken with the saids dilapidationes, Therefore, in
respect the same cannot suddenly be done, but will requyre ane lang tyme and
mature deliberatione, the Assemblie hes given, granted, and committed, lykeas
they, be the tennor heirof, gives, grants, and committs their full power and

<hr class="tb2" />

<p>We have now accomplished the main part of the task in which for some months
past we have been engaged, namely, to print for the first time, in a complete and
connected state, all that now remains of the earliest record of the Reformed
Church of Scotland. That record extends from 1560 to 1616 inclusive. And
as stated in previous notes, the proceedings in the Assemblies, during the period
now referred to, constitute what has been long denominated “The Booke of
the Universall Kirk of Scotland.” The concluding part of our undertaking
still remains to be performed in such illustrative notes and documents as are
requisite for giving coherence and full effect to these important fragments of our
ecclesiastical records; and this portion of our labours shall hereafter be prosecuted
as speedily and comprehensively as the nature of the case admits of, with
a due regard to fidelity in its accomplishment. In the meanwhile, “The Booke,”
forming of itself a volume of sufficient size, it is now given in that shape to the
public.</p>

<p>The reader of the preceding pages is already aware, that all the proceedings of
the Episcopal Assemblies (subsequently to that of 1602) were rescinded by the
Presbyterian Conventions which took place during the reign of Charles I. in 1638
and 1639. Even in the proceedings of the Assemblies soon after 1592, when
Presbyterianism was established, there are various indications of the intentions of
King James VI. to insinuate Episcopacy into the constitution of the Church;
and after his accession to the throne of England, in March 1603, his policy in
this respect became more manifest. Indeed, by an act of Parliament in 1597, (19th
December,) the insidious propositions which had been made in the Assemblies,
for the introduction of clergymen into Parliament, were given effect to, and formed
the first step in the series of encroachments on the Presbyterian polity. Without
at present going minutely into the detail of events which followed, it may
be noticed, with reference to the rescinded acts of Assembly, that even before the
Assembly of 1602, Prelacy was virtually introduced into the Church, and after
that date it was openly established by a series of acts of Parliament. The Assemblies
of 1606, 1608, 1610, and 1616, were all Episcopalian, as is evinced by
the whole course of procedure in those Conventions, which were one and all convoked
and packed by the King, and were held merely for the purpose of registering
his edicts, and giving a colourable aspect to these as clothed with ecclesiastical
sanction. There were two other Assemblies of like character held in the
years 1617 and 1618&mdash;in the latter of which the celebrated Articles of Perth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_600"></a>[600]</span>
were adopted by the Bishops and subservient Clergy; but of the proceedings in
these two Assemblies, there is no fragment in the MS. copies of “The Booke”
to which we have had access; nor, although the nature of these proceedings is
described by Calderwood and other historians, have we been able to discover any
detailed record similar to that which has been preserved of the preceding Assemblies
of the Church. After 1618, General Assemblies were entirely discontinued
for the space of twenty years, until, in 1638, in consequence of the great revulsion
which then took place in Scotland under the guidance of the Covenanters,
another General Assembly was convoked by authority of King Charles the First.</p>

<p>In conformity with the course which we have already adopted with reference to
particular epochs of our Church history, and in order to illustrate the relation
which subsisted betwixt the Church and the State, we shall now, at the close of
“The Booke,” subjoin in an Appendix the principal Acts of Parliament which
were passed in regard to the Church, betwixt 1592 and 1638, when Presbyterianism
was re-established&mdash;thus presenting, in connexion with the Acts of the Church,
all the leading statutory enactments of the State by which the Church polity was
established, modified, and subverted, during a period of seventy-eight years.
And with these few explanatory remarks, we commit “The Booke of the Kirk”
into the hands of our countrymen, being well assured that its pages contain
much important matter, which merits careful examination and study at the present
day.</p>

<p>And now the most grateful part of our task (for the present) only remains&mdash;to
record our thanks for the friendly assistance we have received while engaged
in the present undertaking. We owe our acknowledgments especially to Thomas
Thomson, Esq. Deputy Clerk-Register; to the Rev. Dr Lee; and to Messrs
A. M‘Donald of the Register House, D. Laing and Ferguson, Librarians
for the Writers to the Signet; Mr Haig of the Advocates’ Library; Mr Rowan
of the Theological Library in the University of Edinburgh; to the Rev. W. B.
Smith, Chaplain of Edinburgh Castle; and to the Rev. Thomas M‘Crie, for
many facilities and much useful information, without which the present publication
would have been altogether impracticable at present.</p>

<p class="p2">It was our purpose to have included in the present Volume, a Copious Index
and Glossary of obsolete words, and also to give a list of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">errata</i> which we have
discovered, arising unavoidably from the frequent obscurity of the MSS. and
discrepancies in orthography, besides slips of the pen and the press; but on further
reflexion, it appears expedient to combine these useful addenda with the
<em>Notes</em>, which will be found the more satisfactory corrective of any imperfections
in the text of the Booke itself.</p>

<p class="p1 center">Act anent the King’s Majestie’s Royall Prerogative.</p>

<p class="p1 center">9th July 1606.</p>

<p>Forsameikle as the Estates and haill body of this present Parliament, considering
that with the lawful descent in the person of our most gracious Soveraigne,
of the righteous inheritance of the famous and renouned kingdoms of England,
France, and Ireland, whilk very far surpasses the wealthe, power, and force of
the dominions of any of his progenitours, kings of Scotland, God hath also
joyned an wonderful incresse of care and burding. For discharge whereof, he
hath endued his Majesty with sa many extraordinar graces, and maist rare and
excellent vertues, as he is not only known by daily and manifest experiences, in
matters of greatest difficulty and consequence, to the unspeakable comfort of all
his faithfull subjects, to be capable of the happy government of his saids kingdomes.
But by his most singular judgement, foresight, and princely wisdome,
worthy to possesse, and habile to govern far greater dominions and numbers of
people. And in respect thereof, the saids Estates plainly perceiving that by this
his Majesties exaltation, not only in pre-eminence and power, but also in all royal
qualities requisit for the happy discharge thereof, God hes manifestly expressed
his heavenly will to be, that his Majesties imperial power, whilk God hes sa graciously
enlarged, shall not by them in any sort be impared, prejudged, or diminished;
but rather reverenced and augmented sa farre as possiblie they can.
Therefore the saids Estaites, and haill body of this present Parliament, all in ane
voluntar, humble, faithfull, and united heart, minde and consent, truely acknawledges
his Majesties soveraigne authority, princely power, royall prerogative, and
priviledge of his crown over all estaites, persons, and causes whatsomever within
his said kingdome. And his Majesty, with expresse advyce, consent, and assent
of the saids haill Estaites, ratifies, approves, and perpetually confirmes the samin;
als absolutly, amply and freely in all respects and considerations, as ever his Majesty,
or any of his royall progenitours, kings of Scotland, in any tyme bygane
possessed, used and exercised the samine. And lykewyse, with consent foresaid,
casses, annuls, abrogats, retreats, and rescinds all and whatsomever things attempted,
enacted, done, or hereafter to be done, or intended to the violation,
hurt, derogation, impairing, or prejudice of his Heighnes soveraigne authority,
royall prerogative, and priviledge of his crown, or any point or part thereof, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_603"></a>[603]</span>
any tyme bygane or to come. And the saids haill Estaites, for them and their
successours, faithfully promits, perpetually to acknawledge, obey, maintein, defend,
and advance the lyfe, honour, safety, dignity, soveraigne authority, and prerogative
royall, of his sacred Majesty, his heires and successours, and priviledge of
his Heighnes crown, with their lyves, lands, and goods, to the utermost of their
power, constantly and faithfully to withstand all and whatsomever persons,
powers, or estaites, wha shall presume, prease, or intend any wise to impugne,

<p class="p2 center">III.</p>

<p class="p1 center">Act anent the Restitution of the Estate of Bishops.</p>

<p class="p1 center">9th July 1606.</p>

<p>Our Soveraigne Lord, now in his absence forth of his kingdome of Scotland,
earnestly desiring sa to provyde for the just and politique government of that estate,
as his faithfull subjects thereof may perfitely knaw, that absence breeds not
in his royall mynde oblivion of their good, but that he is daylie mair and mair
cairfull of sik things as may tend maist to the honour, profite, and perpetuall stability
and queytnes of the said kingdome; wherein understanding religion and
justice to be sa necessar foundaments and pillers, as by them the authority of the
princes and queytnesse of the people in all tymes by-past hes cheifly bene established
and mainteined, whill of late in his Majesties young yeares, and unsetled
estaite, the auncient and foundamentall policy, consisting in the maintenance of
the three Estaites of Parliament, hes bene greatly impaired, and almost subverted,
specially by the indirect abolishing of the estaite of bishops, by the act of annexation
of the temporalitie of benefices to the crown, made in his Heighnes Parliament,
halden at Edinburgh in the moneth of July, the year of God 1587. Whereby,
albeit it was never meaned by his Majesty, nor by his Estaites, that the said estaite
of bishops consisting of benefices of cure, and being ane necessare estaite of the
Parliament, should on any wyse be suppressed, yet his Majesty, by experience of
the subsequent tyme, hath clearly seene that the dismembering and abstracting
from them of their livings, hes broght them in sik contempt and poverty, that
they are not habile to furnish necessares to their privat families, meikle lesse to
beare the charges of their wonted rank in Parliament and generall counsails, and
after the example of their predecessours, to assist and supply their prince with
their counsell and goods, in tyme of peace and warre. The remeid whereof properly
perteins to his Majesty, whom the haill estaites of their bounden duety,
with maist heartlie and faithfull affection humbly and truely aknawledges to be
soveraigne monarch, absolute prince, judge and governour over all persons, estaites,
and causes, baith spirituall and temporall, within his said realme.</p>

<p>Therefore, his Majesty, with expresse advyse and consent of the saids haill
Estaites of Parliament, being cairful to repone, restore, and re-integrat the said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_604"></a>[604]</span>
estaite of bishops, to their auncient and accustomed honour, dignities, prerogatives,
priviledges, livings, lands, teynds, rents, thriddes, and estaite, as the samine
was in the Reformed Kirk, maist ample and free at any tyme before the act of
annexation foresaid. By the tenour hereof, retreats, rescinds, reduces, casses,
abrogats, and annulles the foresaid act of annexation of the temporality of benefices
to the crown, made in the yeare of God 1587 years, as said is, in sa far as
the samine may in any wyse comprehend or be extended to the authority, dignity,
prerogative, priviledges, towres, castels, fortalices, lands, kirks, teynds,
thriddes, or rents of the saids bishopriks, or any part thereof, with all other acts
of Parliament, made in prejudice of the saids bishops, in the premisses or any of
them, with all that hes followed or may follow thereupon, and all act of dismembering
of particular kirks, or commoun kirks of the said bishopricks, from the samine,
or for separating the thriddes of the saids bishopricks from the bodie, tytle
and twa-part of the samine. To the effect, the persons presentlie provyded to
the bishopricks of Scotland, or any of them, or that hereafter shall be provyded to
the samine may freely, quyetlie, and peaceablie enjoy, bruike, and possesse the honours,
dignities, priviledges, and prerogatives, competent to them or their estaite
since the reformation of religion: and all towres, fortalices, lands, kirks, teynds,
rents, twa-part, thriddes, patronages, and rights whatsomever, belanging to the
bishopricks, or any of them, to use and exercise the samine, and freelie dispone
upon the haill twa-part and thrid, temporalitie and spiritualitie of their saids
bishopricks, and all the premisses belanging to the saids bishopricks, as the saids
acts of annexation and remanent acts, made in any wyse to their prejudice in the
premisses, and everie ane of them, and all that followed thereupon, had never
bene made nor done. They alwyse enterteining the ministers, serving at the
cure of the kirks of their saids bishopricks, upon the readiest of their saids
thriddes, according to their ordinar assignations made or reasonablie to be made
thereanent.</p>

<p>Attour, Because his Majesties intention is onely to restore the bishopricks
whilks are benefices of cure, and nowyse to alter any thing done in other benefices,
whilks are not of cure. And for the better satisfaction of his Majesties
subjects and faithfull servants, whom his Majestie in his princelie liberalitie, for
diverse good respects and causes mooving him, hath beneficed, rewarded, and advanced
with erections, fewes, patronages, teyndes, and others infeftments, confirmations
of lands, rents, teyndes, patronages, and others rights of abbacies,
pryories, and others benefices, not being bishopricks.</p>

<p>And to the effect they be not prejudged, nor put in mistrust by this act, of
their saids securities in the premisses, his Heighnes, with the advyce of the haill
Estaites of Parliament, ratifies and approves, and for him and his successours perpetuallie
confirmes, the haill erections, infeftments, confirmations, patronages,
tacks, and others securities of lands, teyndes, patronages, rights, and rents whatsomever,
of the saids haill benefices foresaids, or any part thereof, (not being
bishopricks,) given, disponed, or confirmed by his Majestie, during the tyme of
the said Parliament, halden in the moneth of Julie 1587 years of before or sensyne,
made agreeable to the lawes and acts of the said Parliament 1587, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_605"></a>[605]</span>
others lawes and acts made sensyne. And faithfullie promits, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in verbo principis</i>,
never to quarrell nor impugne the samine, directlie nor indirectlie, in any tyme
comming. As also for the well and securitie of the tenants of the lands and
teynds of the saids bishopricks, wha, since the act of annexation, have debursed
diverse summes of money to his Heighnes’ thesaurer, for making and confirming
to them of their infeftments, tacks, and securities of the saids lands, teyndes, and
rents of the bishopricks possest by them. And to the effect the annulling of the
said act of annexation, bereave them not altogether of the saids lands, teyndes,
and rents of bishopricks, acquyred be them upon their large charges and expenses,
according to the law then standing. And that upon the other part, the saids
bishopricks be not altogether made unprofitable, by the unlawfull dilapidation of
the rents thereof, and hurtfull conversion of the victuall, kaines, custumes, and
other commodities of the samine, for unequall and unworthy pryces.</p>

<p>Therefore, his Majestie, with advyse of his Estaits foresaids, Ordeins the saids
persons possessours of the lands or teyndes of bishopricks by virtue of infeftments,
confirmations or tacks of the samine granted or sett since the said act of annexation,
and conforme to the samine, and lawes of the realme, at the tyme of the
making thereof, shall have the securities, confirmations, tacks and rights of the
saids lands and teynds of the bishopricks foresaids, renewed and granted to them
in sufficient, valeid, and perfite forme by the bishops, possessours of the saids
benefices. The saids fewers, tacksmen and tenants, paying to the saids bishops,
for gressum, entresse and composition, for renewing of their saids fewes of all
lands, and others belanging to the saids bishopricks; and als ratification of their
saids tacks of all teyndes perteining thereto; Of the whilks at the day and date
hereof, there are ten yeares crops of the samine to runne; The double of the
yearlie silver duetie, conteined in their saids fewes and tacks; and the single of
the victual duetie, and of all others dueties expressed therein, and that by and
attour the yearlie duetie expressed in their saids fewes and tacks: The whilks
dueties, for gressum, entresse and composition, the haill Estaites of Parliament
declares, shall be payed by the saids fewers, tacksmen and tenants, within yeare
and day, after they be lawfullie cited to that effect, and for that samine cause, or
after that intimation of the samine be made to them, by the bishops in their awne
courts.</p>

<p>And in case of not thankful payment, of the double of the said silver duetie,
and of the single of the said victual, and others dueties to be payed within yeare
and day, after the said citation and intimation, as said is; The saids Estaites of
Parliament findes and declares, that the saids fewers and tacksmen shall be astricted
to pay after the expyring of the said yeare and day, thankfull payment not
being made within that space of the foresaids gressumes, entresse and composition,
extending to the quantitie above written; the quadruple of the silver duetie, and
the double of the said victual, and others dueties foresaids, to be payed to the
saids bishops, by and attour the yearlie dueties conteined in the saids fewes and
tacks, as is before said. And the saids Estaites ordeines and declares, that if
there be not ten years compleit to runne of the saids tacks of teynds, perteining
to the kirks of the saids bishopricks, after the day and date hereof; in that case,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_606"></a>[606]</span>
the tacksmen on nawyse shall be astricted to pay any gressum, entresse or composition
for the samine, to the saids bishops, but they to be free thereof.</p>

<p>Attour, the saids Estaites declares, that the said act and ordinance of Parliament
shall nowyse be extended, comprehend, nor prejudge any fewes of bishopricks,
lawfullie sett and confirmed before the said act of annexation, whilk was
in the said moneth of Julie, ane thousand, five hundreth, fourscore seven years.
Excepting and reserving alwyse forth of this present act, all dispositions made of
whatsomever patronages of kirks perteining to the saids bishopricks, disponed by
lawful titulares, and the King’s Majesty, and ratified in Parliament, in favours of
whatsomever person or persons, and nane others. And findes and declares all
dispositions whatsomever, made of the foresaids patronages of all kirks perteining
to the bishopricks disponed by the lawful titulares, and his Majesty, and not confirmed
in Parliament, to be of nane avail, although the samine patronages be
graunted and disponed by the King’s Majesty and titulares thereof. And lykwyse,
excepting and reserving all common kirks, perteining of auld to the saids bishopes,
and their chapter in commounity, whilks are disponed by his Majesty, to whatsomever

declares, that if there be any common kirks, perteining to the saids bishopricks,
and to their chapters of auld, that now perteins and falles to them be vertew of
this present act, That thereby the ministers, wha are lawfully provided to the
saids common kirks by presentation, collation, and admission, and serving thereat,

shall be sufficient right and warrand to the saids ministers, to bruike, joyce, and
possesse their common kirks foresaids, according as they are provyded thereto,
for all the dayes of their lyfetymes. Notwithstanding whatsomever clause conteined
in this present act, or any other act of Parliament, that might make any derogation
to the saids provisions. Excepting alwyse, and reserving the Castell of
Sainct-Androes, and castell yardes of the samine, disponed to George Earle of
Dumbar, upon the resignation of George Arch-bishoppe of Sainct-Androes, dissolved
and dismembered from the said archbishoprick, by Our said Soveraigne
Lord and Estaites, with expresse consent and assent of the said Arch-bishoppe,
personally compearand in Parliament. Whom to Our said Soveraigne Lord, in
place and recompence of the said castell, hes given and disponed the provestry
of Kirkhill, viccarge and arch-deinrie of Sainct-Androes, to remaine with the
said arch-bishop and his successours, by and attour ane yearly pension of three
hundreth markes, given to the said arch-bishop, sa that the said castell and castell
yardes shall nowyse be comprehended in this present act, nor yet shall be compted

samine infeftments to stand in the awne strength, notwithstanding this present
act. Provyding alwyse, that the said Sir Robert Malvill and his heires sustaine
and entertaine the ministers serving at the said kirk, upon the frutes of the samine
kirk. And notwithstanding this present act and haill clauses therein conteined,
Our said Soveraigne Lord, with advyse foresaid, having considered the fewers of
the barony of Glasgow, to be many in number, and the poverty of the maist part
of them to be sik as they are not habile to furnishe the ordinare charges for renewing
their infeftments, have dispensed, and by this present act dispenses anent

<p class="p1 center">Act of the Commissariats and Jurisdiction given to Archbishops and Bishops.</p>

<p class="p1 center">24th June 1609.</p>

<p>Our Soveraigne Lord, understanding that in all well governed republicks, the

whilk aught to be administrat by the persons to whom the same properly belangs;
and according to his Heighnes most loving and princely affection born alwise to
the Christian reformed Kirk within this realme, being maist willing that the said
Kirk should bruike and joyse their liberties, priviledges, freedom, and jurisdiction
granted to them by his Majesty, (from whom only their temporall jurisdiction
doth flow,) and in that regarde belanging to them as being ane of the estates of
Parliament maist necessare to be mainteined for giving their advice, counsell, and
assistance in all his Majestie’s great and waighty affaires, hes with expresse advice
and consent of the Estates of Parliament, restored and redintegrate the Archbishops
and Bishops of this realme to their former authority, dignity, prerogative,
priviledges, and jurisdictions lawfully pertaining, and shall be knawne to pertain

of justice by their commissioners and deputies in all spirituall and ecclesiasticall
causes contraverted betwene any persons dwelling within the bounds and
diocies of their prelacies and bishopricks; with full power to the saids archbishops,
bishops, and their successours in all tyme hereafter, to nominat and create sufficient
wise, discreit, and learned men best acquainted with the law and practick
of this realme, to serve and administrat justice in the saids places of judicatorie,
to constitute clerks and all other under officers, sa oft as the same shall vaik by
dimission, decease, deprivation, or otherwyse, and to provide others in their

realme formerly hes done. Whilks commissares to be nominat and create by
them, shall judge and decyde in all causes belanging to their judicatory. And
wherein the commissares presently in office are in use to decyde, keeping the
same style and forme whilk is presently observed, and that manner of proceeding

them. And that because they are his Majestie’s great consistory, to whom his
Heighnes, with advyce of the said Estates, gives and grants an heigh supreme
commission for all sik causes, to judge and determine of them in sik causes. And
declares that it shall be lawfull to the saids Lords of Councell and Session, to
advocat causes to themselves from any of the commissares, upon just and lawfull
complaints made to them by any of the subjects, and not otherwise. Provyding
alwyse, that the said Session shall ever be ready to give an account to his Majesty,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_609"></a>[609]</span>
that their advocations have bene grounded upon probable and lawfull grounds for
the well of the subjects. And that this foresaid Act may be put in present
effect, his Majesty, with advyce foresaid, declares all former erections of commissariates
to be suppressed and extinct from this forth and for ever, all constitutions
that have bene in former tyme of the same in whatsoever part of the realme the

Otherwise, if in case the saids commissares and others members of court do not
produce the foresaid testimoniall from the Lords of Session, as said is, it shall be
lawfull to the archbishops and bishops to provide other sufficient persons to the
saids places. The restitution of the said jurisdiction alwyse to be with expresse
reservation of his Heighnes and his successours their prerogatives and supremacie

<p class="p1 center">24th June 1609.</p>

<p>Attour, his Majesty and Estaites foresaids, considering what slander and contempt
hes arisen to the ecclesiasticall estate of this kingdom by the occasion of
the light and undecent apparell used by some of that profession, and chiefly these
having vote in Parliament: It is therefore statute that every preacher of God’s
word shall hereafter weare black, grave and comely apparell beseeming men of
their estate and profession. As lykewise that all pryors, abbots, and prelates,
having vote in Parliament, and specially bishops, shall weare grave and decent
apparrell agreeable to their function, and as appertaines to men of their rank,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_610"></a>[610]</span>

that God of his great mercy hes made the people and subjects of this
country sa happy as to have a King raigne over us, wha is maist godly, wyse, and
religious; hating all erronious and vaine superstition, just in government, and of
lang experience therein, knawing better then any King living what apperteins and
is convenient for every estate in their behaviour and duty. Therefore it is agreed
and consented to by the Estates, that what order sa ever his Majesty in his great
wisdome shall think meet to prescrive for the apparell of kirk-men agreable to
their estate and moyen; the same being sent in writ by his Majesty to his Clerk
of Register, shall be a sufficient warrant to him for inserting thereof in the
buikes of Parliament to have the strength and effect of an act thereof, with executorials
of horning to be direct thereupon, against sic persons as within the
space of fourty dayes after the publication or intimation to them of the said act
or charges used against them thereupon, shall not provyde themselves of the apparell
to be appoynted by his Majesty for men of their vocation and estate, to be

yeares, determining all the doubtfull and contraverted points concerning the

against or in favours of any person, without the knawledge and approbation of
the bishop of the diocie, who most be answerable to God and his Majesty for all
formall and unpartiall proceeding therein: And the process beeing found formall,

they may lawfully refuse any sik person presented unto them. But if the party
who is presented hath reserved to himself and his successors a sufficient maintenance,
the setting of tacks or promise to do the same, or doing of any thing
else to his patron, (being not prejudicial to that aforesaid maintenance,) shall no

<p class="p1 center">Act Anent the Restitution of Chapters.</p>

<p class="p1 center">28th June 1617.</p>

<p>Our Soveraigne Lord, with advise and consent of the Estates of this present
Parliament: Considering how necessar it is that the deane, and members of
Chapter of every Cathedral Kirk, be at all occasions ready to conveene themselves
for the election of arch-bishops and bishops, to their severall seas, and
for expeding of particular rights made to the lieges, whereunto their consent by
the lawes of the realme is required, and that for supporting of the charges of
their service, and inabling them the better to attend at sick occasions, It is most
needfull they be restored to their manses, gleibs, rents, and livings belonging
unto them of auld,</p>

<p>Have statute and ordained, that all the deanes and uthers members of the
Chapters of the Cathedral Kirks within this kingdom, shall be restored to their
manses, gleibes, rents, and uther patrimony belonging to them.</p>

<p>And to that effect, his Majesty, with advise of the said Estates, dissolves fra
the Crowne and patrimony thereof, the foresaids manses, gleibes, rentes, and
dueties formerly annexed: to the effect the same may hereafter be injoyed and
peaceably possessed be the ministers that are, and hereafter shall be provyded
thereto. Without prejudice alwayes of the fews, tacks, pensions, and uther rights
lawfully made of whatsumever manses, gleibs, lands, and teynds of any part of
the saids Chapter Kirks to the parties having right to the same. And siklyke
but prejudice to laick patrons of their patronages granted to them be the King’s
Majesty, with consent of the titulars for the tyme, albeit the same be not ratified
in Parliament, which shall na wayes be prejudged be this present act. And
with expresse reservation of the rights of the priorie of Sanct-Androes, now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_615"></a>[615]</span>
erected in a temporall lordship in favours of Ludovick Duke of Lennox, and
his heirs, which shall remaine in the awne strength and integrity, notwithstanding
of the act of restitution above-written, and any thing therein comprehended.</p>

<p>And als with reservation of the house and place of Hamiltoun, biggings and
orchards, yeards, and whole pertinents of the same, in so far as the same or
any part thereof perteined of before to the Deanrie of Glasgow, which his Majesty
and Estates reserves furth of this present act, to his trustie cousin James,
Marques of Hamiltoun, and his successours, to be halden of his Majesty and his
Heighnes successours, as their immediat superiours thereof for ever. And
without prejudice to the burgh of Edinburgh, of whatsumever rents, profites,
tenements, annualrents, teynd-sheaves, and other commodities given, granted,

And siklike but prejudice of whatsomever teynds, few-mails, or annualrents
which perteined of auld to the saids chapters in common, or to any Prebendar

of Sanct-Androes, masters or bursers thereof, which his Majesty, with
advice of the Estates, declares shall not be prejudged by this present act. And
als according to the restrictions, exceptions, and limitations, conceived in favours
of fewars, tacksmen, and others havand right particularly set down and
expressed in the second act of his Majestie’s eighteenth Parliament, concerning
the restitution of the estate of bishops. Which restrictions, exceptions, and
limitations, are halden as repeated and exprest in this present act. And to the
effect, that all sick persons who are and have been tenents and vassals to
deanes and other members of Cathedral Kirks may be in certainty known, and
by whom they should be entred and received in the lands and others halden by
them of the saids deane and members, or any of them,</p>

<p>Therefore it is statute and ordeined by our Soveraigne Lord and Estates,
That when any sik occasion shall offer of receiving or entring of vassals, or of
changing of tennents who comes in the vassal’s places, either by alienation of
the vassals, or comprysing from him, or by any other lawfull manner, the direct
superiour of whom the said vassall immediatly held, shall be astricted and halden
to do the same, and to enter all sik persons by himself, (they doing their duety
to their superiors as apperteins.) In the which case, Our Soveraigne Lord
and Estates declares the consent of the Prelate, or remanent members of his
chapter, no wayes to be necessar to the said entry or change of tennents. And
because the priory of Sanct-Andrewes is now erected in ane temporal living
and lordship, the Prior whereof in former times was alwayes deane of the
chapter of Sanct-Andrewes, and the chanons thereof were the members of the
said chapter which are now all abolished, and to the effect there be not wanting
ane chapter to the said Kirk.</p>

<p>Our Soveraigne Lord, with advice foresaid, declares that the ministers serving
the cure at the Kirks under-written, present and to come, shall be esteemed the
chapter thereof: they are to say, the Prior of Portmook, who is principal of
S. Leonard’s Colledge, and deane of the Chapter: the arch-dean of S. Andrewes;
the Vicar of S. Andrewes; the Vicar of Leuchers; the Vicar of

being all twenty foure persons. Which persons shall have the administration,
doing and performing of the affairs belonging to the said bishoprick,
and for the weale of the said Cathedral Kirk, which were done of before
by the prior and his chanons. And concerning the election of the Archbishop
of the said see, whensoever the same shall hereafter vaik,</p>

<p>Our Soveraigne Lord, with advise foresaid, declares, statutes, and ordeins the
said Arch-bishop to be elected by eight bishops of his diocy. They are to say,
the Bishop of Dunkeld; the Bishop of Aberdein; the Bishop of Brechin; the
Bishop of Dumblain; the Bishop of Ross; the Bishop of Murray; the Bishop
of Orkney; and the Bishop of Caithness. And by five ministers serving the
cure of the Kirks under-written, to wit, the Principal of S. Leonard’s Colledge;
the Arch-deane of S. Andrewes; the Vicar of S. Andrewes; the Vicar of
Luchars; and the Vicar of Cowper. Which bishops and ministers, or the
most part of them, shall have power in all time to come to elect the Arch-bishop
whenever the see shall vaik, and shall remain hereafter the chapter appointed
by our Soveraigne Lord and Estates for the election foresaid. The
Vicar-general for conveining of the which electors, our Soveraigne Lord and
Estates declares to be now and in all time comming, the Bishop of Dunkeld,
who shall happen be for the time. And siklike, Our Soveraigne Lord, with advise
of his Estates, declares, statutes, and ordeins, that the Archbishop of Glasgow,
whensoever that see shall vaik, shall be elected by the three Bishops of
his diocie, to wit, the Bishop of Galloway, the Bishop of Argyle, the Bishop of
the Iles, being for the time, and by his ordinar chapter, or the most part of
them, the Bishop of Galloway being alwayes conveiner of the saids electors to
the said election. Which persons shall have power onely in the said election,
seeing it is the expresse will and ordinance of his Majesty and Estates, that the
auld and ordinar chapter of Glasgow, and the other chapter above-written, appointed
for the see of Sanct-Andrewes, as said is, shall have the only administration
of these things, concerning the affairs tending to the weal of their Cathedral
Kirks, and belonging thereto, as the auld chapter formerly had, and
these others chapters before-mentioned, appointed allanerly for election of the
saids Arch-bishops, shall no wayes be derogatory to the others ordinary chapters
established for the handling of the affairs of their seas in manner above-written.</p>

<p class="p2 center">IX.</p>

<p class="p1 center">A Ratification of the Five Articles of the General Assembly of the Kirk,
halden at Perth in the Moneth of August 1618.</p>

<p class="p1 center">4th August 1621.</p>

<p>Our Soveraigne Lord, with the advice and consent of the Estates of Parliament
presently conveened, ratifies and approves the acts of the General Assembly
of the Kirk, halden at Perth the xxv. day of August, the year of God 1618,
and concluded the twenty-seventh of the same moneth, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sessione secunda</i>.
Whereof the tenour followeth.</p>

<p>1. Since we are commanded by God himselfe, that when we come to worship
him, we fall down and kneele before the Lord our Maker, and considering with
all, that there is no part of Divine worship more heavenly and spiritual, then is
the holy receiving of the blessed body and blood of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ: Lyke as the most humble and reverend gesture of the body in our meditation
and lifting up of our hearts, best becometh so divine and sacred an action.
Therefore, notwithstanding that our Kirk hath used since the Reformation
of religion, to celebrate the holy communion to the people sitting, by reason of
the great abuse of kneeling used in the idolatrous worship of the sacrament by
the Papists: Yet now, seeing all memory of by-past superstition is past, In
reverence of God, and in due regard of so divine a mystery, and in remembrance
of so mystical ane union, as we are made partakers of: The Assembly thinketh
good, that that blessed sacrament be celebrated hereafter meekly and reverently
upon their knees.</p>

<p>2. <em>Item</em>, If any good Christian visited with long sickness, and knowne to the
pastor; by reason of his present infirmity, unable to resort to the Kirke, for receiving
of the holy communion, or being sick, shall declare to the pastor upon
his conscience, that he thinkes his sickness to be deadly, and shall earnestly desire
to receive the same in his house: The minister shall not deny to him so
great a comfort, lawful warning being given to him upon the night before, and
that there be three or foure of good religion and conversation, free of lawful impediments,
present with the sick person to communicate with him, who must
also provide a convenient place in his house; and all things necessary for the reverend
administration thereof, according to the order prescrived in the Kirke.</p>

<p>3. <em>Item</em>, The minister shall often admonish the people, that they defer not
the baptising of infants, any longer then the next Lord’s day after the child be
borne, unlesse upon a great and reasonable cause declared to the minister, and
by him approved. As also they shall warne them, that without great cause they
procure not their children to be baptized at home in their houses, but when great
need shall compell them to baptize in privat houses, (in which case, the minister
shall not refuse to do it, upon the knowledge of the great need, and being
timely required thereto,) then baptisme shall be administred after the same forme
as it should have been in the congregation. And the minister shall the next<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_618"></a>[618]</span>
Lordes day after any such private baptisme, declare in the Kirke, that the infant
was so baptized, and therefore ought to be received as one of the true flocke of
Christ’s folde.</p>

<p>4. <em>Item</em>, Forasmuch as one of the most special meanes for staying the increase
of Poperie, and settling of true religion in the hearts of the people, is,
That a special care be taken in tryal of young children their education, and how
they are catechized; Which in time of the primitive kirk was most carefully attended,
as being most profitable to cause young children, in their tender yeares,
drink in the knowledge of God and his religion, but is now altogether neglected
in respect of great abuse and errours which crept into the Popish Kirk, by
making thereof a sacrament of confirmation: Therefore, that all superstitions
built thereupon may be rescinded, and that the matter it selfe being most necessary
for the education of the youth, may be reduced to the primitive integrity.</p>

<p>It is thought good that the minister in every parish shall catechize all young
children of eight yeares of age, and see that they have the knowledge, and be
able to make rehearsal of the Lord’s Prayer, Belief, and Ten Commandments,
with answers to the questions of the small Catechisme used in our kirke: And
that every bishop in his visitation shall censure the minister who shall be found
remiss therein, and the saides bishopes shall cause the saides children to be presented
before them, and blesse them with prayer for the increase of their knowledge,
and continuance of God’s heavenly graces with every one of them.</p>

<p>5. <em>Item</em>, As wee abhorre the superstitious observation of festival dayes by
the Papists, and detest all licentious and profane abuse thereof, by the common
sort of professors; So we think, that the inestimable benefites receaved from God,
by our Lord Jesus Christ, his birth, passion, resurrection, ascension, and sending
down of the Holy Ghost, was commendably and godly remembered, at certain
particular dayes and times by the whole kirk of the world; and may be also
now. Therefore the Assembly ordaines, that every minister shall upon these
dayes have the commemoration of the foresaids inestimable benefits, and make
choice of several and pertinent texts of Scripture, and frame their doctrine and
exhortations thereto; and rebuke all superstitious observation and licentious profanation
thereof.</p>

<p>Which articles and ordinances, Our Soveraigne Lord, with advice and consent
of the Estates, statutes and ordaines to be obeyed and observed by all his Majesties
subjects as lawes in time comming; Annulling and rescinding whatsomever
other acts of Parliament, constitutions and customes, in so farre as they are
derogative to any of the articles above-written.</p>

Church affairs, in the first Parliament of King Charles I., 28th June 1633, such
as that anent His Majestie’s Royal Prerogative and Apparel of Kirkmen&mdash;anent
His Majestie’s annuity of Tiends&mdash;the Submissions and Decrees-arbitral
anent the valuation of Tiends, &amp;c.; but these being easily accessible to all, and
not immediately necessary for illustrating the revolution which took place in
the Church during the period with which we are at present concerned, it is not
necessary here to include them.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_49" href="#FNanchor_49" class="label">[49]</a> On the margin of each of the sections in this chapter, marked with asterisks,
(viz. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 28, 29, 30, 31,) there is a reference written in precisely
the same words: “<em>Jac. 6, p. 12, c. 114, 3 Junie 1592</em>.” This is in a handwriting,
and in ink, evidently different from those in the text&mdash;and must have
been superinduced subsequently to the act of Parliament 1592, to which these
references plainly allude. The date and chapter, however, cited, do not coincide
with those of the charter of the Presbyterian Kirk. In the common 12mo old
edition of the Acts, the date is <em>fifth</em> June, not <em>third</em>, and the chapter is 116, not
114, as noted in these marginal references. But notwithstanding these discrepancies,
it is extremely probable that the Presbytery of Haddington having, in
obedience to the act of Assembly of Aug. 1590, subscribed the Book of Policie,
in Sept. 1591, (the year before the act of 1592 was passed,) the Official Custodier
of their copy had engrossed these marginal jottings upon it, soon after the
passing of the act of Parliament 1592, for the purpose of pointing out those articles
in the Book of Policie, which had been <em>sanctioned by Parliament</em>, so as to
<em>mark</em> what had been adopted, and to distinguish such articles from those which
had not been acceded to. That this was the case may be inferred from a comparison
of the terms of these articles, and of the act 1592.</p>

<p>It may not be deemed much out of place to remark here, that we were not a
little surprised to see in the pleadings from the bar in the Auchterarder case,
and in the opinion of one of the Judges, an argument maintained, seemingly with
much confidence, rested on certain marginal memoranda, said to be found in
Spottiswood’s History, with reference to a conference held at Stirling, in 1578,
betwixt Commissioners of the Estates and Commissioners of the Kirk; the
ground of confidence in these memoranda being, that Spottiswood had “set
down the form of policy as it was presented, with the notes of <em>their agreement</em>
and <em>disagreement</em>, as they stand in the original, which (says the Book) <em>I
have by me</em>.”&mdash;(Spottiswood’s Hist. p. 289.)</p>

<p>Now, all the argument alluded to is grounded on the hypothesis, that Spottiswood’s
<em>printed</em> History is an authentic and credible authority. But this is by no
means the case: and without going into any lengthened statement, we shall suggest
two objections which appear to render the History <em>ascribed</em> to Archbishop
Spottiswood, unworthy of credit. In the first place, the only MS. of the Archbishop’s
work (reputed to be either the original or a revised copy) is in the Advocates’
Library, and in that MS. not one word of the passage quoted&mdash;of the Book
of Policy&mdash;or of the marginal notes, is to be found; nor (so far as we can discover)
any reference to these. And independently of this, the whole MS. is so much
mangled and interpolated, and large additions made to it, that it is impossible,
without strong collateral evidence, to assume <em>any thing</em> in the <em>printed</em> Book as bearing
Spottiswood’s personal testimony. But <em>secondly</em>, there is a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</i> presumption
against the authenticity of that printed history, independently of its being destitute
of any proper voucher. The Archbishop died in the end of the year 1639.
In the publisher’s preface to the first edition of it, which was published in 1655,
that is, sixteen years after the Archbishop’s death, we are told that “a copy of it
lighted into ingenuous and noble hands;”&mdash;and in the close of the Life prefixed,
we are told that it “was like an infant of the Israelites in an ark of reeds.”
This is the whole amount of information given with respect to the history generally
ascribed to Spottiswood! That the unfortunate Prelate left a MS. history,
or fragments, we have no doubt; but we have never seen any evidence to show,
that the published book corresponds with what he had written; and therefore we
conclude that that work, as we now have it, is altogether spurious, and that it
cannot safely be relied on as an authority, much less as a record of the individual
<em>testimony</em> of the Archbishop, whatever be its complexion, on any one
point in the transactions of those times. There are various minute particulars in
regard to the copy of the Book of Policie, and Notes in that work, which we
may hereafter have occasion to notice, but which would be unsuitable in this
place.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_50" href="#FNanchor_50" class="label">[50]</a> On the margin of the Haddington copy of the Book of Policy, opposite to
this section, there is a note written, but not in the same handwriting as the Book
itself. It seems to have been added as a scriptural authority for the provision in
this article, and is in the following terms: “Tim. 5, 17. The eldars that rule
wel are worthie of double honour, speciallie they which labour in word and doctrine.”
And interjected and interlined with sections 26 and 27, are some lines,
containing an extract from Beza’s translation of the New Testament, which, however,
it is unnecessary to insert here.</p>

the proceedings of which are contained in that copy. The acts of this Assembly
are omitted at the proper place in the more modern copy which we have used, but
interjected at a subsequent part of the volume among various miscellaneous documents
not referable to that period. The more ancient copy, however, is now preferred.</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
